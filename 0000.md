### Kernal working address pointer
These locations are used as a pointer to the address of the current
byte to be written to tape or saved to disk, or the address
where the byte read from tape or from a disk boot sector is to
be stored. The Kernal has several routines to service this pointer,
including:

* [$ED51](E000#ED51) load this pointer with the operation starting address in [$C1-$C2](#C1)
* [$EEC1](E000#EEC1) increment the address here
* [$EEB7](E000#EEB7) compare the address here against the operation ending address at [$AE-$AF](#AE)

There is also a routine [$F7CC](E000#F7CC) to retrieve the character at
the pointer address from the bank specified in [$C6](#C6),
and one [$F7BC](E000#F7BC) to store the current accumulator contents at
the pointer address in the bank specified in [$C6](#C6).

### Work area for disk booting
The Kernal BOOT_CALL routine [$F890](E000#F890) uses locations
$AC-$AD to hold the address at which the contents
of additional boot sectors are to be stored. Location $AE
holds the bank number for the additional data. Location $AF
holds the number of disk sectors to be loaded during the
boot process.

## 174-175 $AE-$AF EAL-E AH
### Kernal address pointer
This location is used during the routines which read from or
write to tape, or in saving to disk, to hold the ending address
for the operation. For loading from disk, this location is used
as a working pointer to the address where data is stored. After
all bytes have been loaded, the locations will hold the ending
address.

Actually, in all cases the pointer will hold the address
of the location immediately following the last one involved in the
operation. The Kernal SAVE routine [$F53E](E000#F53E)
initializes these locations with the contents of the X and Y registers
when the routine is called. The Kernal provides a routine
[$F7C9](E000#F7C9) to retrieve the character at the pointer address from
the bank specified in [$C6](#C6), and one [$F7BF](E000#F7BF) to store the
current accumulator contents at the pointer address in the
bank specified in [$C6](#C6).

## 250 $FA Unused
This memory location is considered unused in that no Commodore 128 Kernal or BASIC routine deliberately changes it. However, due to a bug in the screen editor CINT [$C07B](C000#C07B) and SWAPPER [$CD2E](C000#CD2E) routines, it is overwritten whenever those routines run.

Since these routines are triggered during the RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequence, any value you store here will be lost whenever you press RUN/STOP-RESTORE or switch screens. For this reason, if you use this location in your programs, it should only serve as temporary working space, not for storing important data that you need to keep in the situations mentioned above.

## 251-254 $FB-$FE Unused
These memory locations are not used by any Commodore 128 ROM routines, making them available for your BASIC or machine language programs. They are not affected by the RUN/STOP-RESTORE key combination. However, keep in mind that all zero-page locations, including these, are cleared to zero during a resetâ€”unless the RUN/STOP key is held down while resetting. For more information, refer to the reset routine at [$E000](E000#E000).

## 255 $FF
This location is used as part of the assembly area for character
strings representing the digits of numeric values.
