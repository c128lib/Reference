# Cassette Buffer and Disk Boot Buffer

## 2816-3071/$0B00-$0BFF <a name="0B00"></a>
The first 192 bytes of this area (2818-3007/$0B00-$0BBF) are
used for the cassette buffer. When you're reading from tape,
file headers are loaded into this area until one is found with
the specified filename. When you're writing to tape, this area
is used to assemble the tape header for the file. When the
buffer contains a tape header, the locations are used as follows:

|Location|Function|
|-|-|
|2816/$0B00|Header type identifier|
|2817-2818/$0B01-$0B02|Starting address for file|
|2819-2820/$0B03-$0B04|Ending address for file|
|2821-3007/$0B05-$0BBF|Filename|

A header type identifier of 1 indicates a relocatable program
file; 3 indicates a nonrelocatable program file; 4, a data file;
and 5, an end-of-tape marker. A type identifier value of 2
means that the block contains data rather than a header. Although
the filename can be up to 187 bytes long, such names
are unusual. When a header is read into the buffer, only the
first 16 characters of the filename will be displayed following
the FOUND message. When a header is being assembled, all
unused filename bytes will be set to 32/$20, the value for the
space character.

The cassette buffer is used to hold blocks of data when
data files are read from or written to tape. When a data file is
being written, after the header is written to tape, the first byte
here is set to 2, the identifier for a data block; then the remaining
191 bytes are filled with the data to be written to the
file. Only when the buffer is completely full is the block of
data actually added to the file. This is why it is important to
properly close any file opened for writing. If the file is not
closed, the last block of data will not be written to tape. When
a file is opened for reading, after the proper header is identified,
the first block of data is read into the buffer. Subsequent
bytes will be read from the buffer-not directly from tapeuntil all
191 data bytes have been read from the buffer; then
the next block will be read into the buffer.

In the 128, this area has a second function: the boot sector
buffer. If the BOOT_CALL routine [$F890](F000#F890) finds a disk in the
specified drive when it is called, the contents of sector 0 of
track 1 of the disk are read into this area. The first three bytes
of the buffer are then examined. If those locations (the first
three bytes from the sector) contain the character codes for the
letters CBM, then the routine assumes that a boot disk has
been found and proceeds with the boot process.
It would be possible to simulate
a boot by filling the buffer with the proper values, then jumping into
the BOOT_CALL routine at address [$F8F9](F000#F8F9).

The BOOT_CALL routine is normally executed during
each reset as part of the BASIC cold-start sequence. It can also
be called from the Kernal jump table entry at 65363/$FF53,
and can be initiated from BASIC via the BOOT statement.

Actually, the cassette buffer is not located absolutely at
this area. The base address of the cassette buffer is determined
by the value in locations [$B2-$B3](0000#B2). Those locations
are initialized to 2816/$0B00 during the RAMTAS routine
[$E093](E000#E093), part of the reset sequence. No system ROM routines
change that setting, but another free 192-byte area could be
used, with two restrictions: the buffer must start at an address
greater than 511/$1FF, and the buffer must be visible in the
bank 15 memory configuration. The disk-booting routines, on
the other hand, do use the absolute address of this area. This
area will always be used as the boot sector buffer, regardless
of the value in the cassette buffer pointer.

If tape data storage is not being used, this 256-byte area is
available for other uses, such as to hold short machine language
routines. The cassette buffer has been a popular area for
ML since the days of the first Commodore PET /CBM computers. However,
the contents of this area will be overwritten
whenever the system attempts to boot a disk, including the
time during any reset when the drive is turned on and contains
a disk. You should choose another area if you want your
machine language to survive intact following a reset.
