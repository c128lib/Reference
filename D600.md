### Address/status register

The VDC actually has two different registers at this location: a
write-only address register and a read-only status register. Any
value you store in this location goes to the address register.

The value specifies which one of the 37 internal VDC registers
can be accessed via the data register at [54785/$D601](#D601). Since
only six bits are needed to specify all the valid register numbers (0-36),
bits 6 and 7 of the address register are unused
and have no effect when you are writing to this register.

You can't read this location to determine which internal
register is being accessed; reading always returns the status
register contents. The status register bits are defined as
follows:

**Bits 0-2**: these locations hold a constant number (like a ROM
location) indicating the version number of the VDC chip currently installed. There have been two versions of the VDC to
date. In early 128s, the value here will be %000 = 0, while in
later models the value will be %001 = 1, The exact difference
between the versions is not clear, but they do require slightly
different initialization. Specifically, internal register 25, the
horizontal smooth scrolling register, requires different settings
for the different versions. The IOINIT routine [$E109](E109) checks
these VDC status register bits and performs the initialization
accordingly.

**Bits 3-4**: these bits are unused, and always return %0 when
read.

**Bit 5**: This bit, called the VBLANK flag, is used to indicate
when the VDC raster scan is in its vertical blank period. After
a full screen has been drawn and the electron beam has reached
the lower right corner of the display, the beam must be turned
off briefly while it is moved back to its home position in the
upper left corner to begin the next frame. Otherwise, moving
the beam would result in a diagonal line across the screen.
The time while the beam is turned off for this repositioning is
called the vertical blanking interval.

This bit, normally %0,
will be set to %1 during the vertical blanking period.
When you're programming special screen effects, it's
handy to know when the blanking period is occurring. The
time when one frame has been completely drawn but another
one has not yet been started is a good time to change screen
parameters without causing excessive flicker. The VIC chip can
generate a raster interrupt to signal when its vertical blanking
interval is beginning, but the VDC chip can't generate interrupt requests, so this bit provides an alternate method of signaling that vertical blanking is in progress.

**Bit 6**: This bit, known as the LP flag, is used to indicate when
new values have been latched in the internal light pen registers. Whenever a pulse is detected on the VDC chip's LP input
line, the row and column positions of the raster beam at that
time are latched into internal registers 16—17/$10-$ll and
this bit is set to %1. This bit will remain %1 until one or both
of the internal light pen registers are read, at which time it
will be reset to %0.

Thus, a %1 in this bit is a signal that a
new light pen position can be read from the internal registers,
while a %0 indicates that the register values have not changed
since they were last read. See the entry for internal registers
16-17/$10-$ll for details of light pen reading.

**Bit 7**: This bit, known as the STATUS flag, is used to indicate
that the VDC is ready to read from or write to the internal
register specified by writing to the external address register.
The flag bit will be set to %0 when a value is stored in this Io
cation, and will return to %1 whe n the specified register is
ready for access. The standard procedure for reading from or
writing to a VDC register is as follows.

Writing:
<pre>
    ldx #register number
    stx $D600
  Wait:
    ldx $D600
    bpl Wait
    lda $D601
</pre>

Reading:
<pre>
    ldx #register number
    stx $D600
  Wait:
    ldx $D600
    bpl Wait
    sta $D601
</pre>

### Data register

This register is the gateway to the internal registers of the
VDC. After you have set the desired internal register number
by writing to the address register at [54784/$D600](#D600), the specified
register becomes visible at this location.

Reading from this
location shows the internal register contents, and writing to
this location stores the value in the internal register. Once you
specify an internal register, that register remains visible here
until you change registers by storing a new value in 54784/
$D600. Refer to the internal register descriptions below for
more information on the effects of reading from and writing to
the various registers.

Commodore's specifications for this chip state that when
accessing the VDC, you should avoid machine language instructions
that use the indirect addressing mode. That is, you
should avoid using instructions like LDA ($CC),Y to read this
register because the VDC apparently responds improperly to
such instructions. This imposes no particular hardship on machine language
programmers, but has highly unfortunate consequences for BASIC programmers.

The 128's PEEK, POKE,
and WAIT instructions are implemented using the Kernal
INDFET, INDSTA, and INDCMP routines, all of which use indirect-Y addressing to read or store values. As a result, you
should not use PEEK, POKE, or WAIT statements to read or
change the contents of this location or of location 54784/$D600.

This would seem to make the VDC inaccessible from
BASIC. Fortunately, a pair of screen editor ROM routines provide a
simple detour around this roadblock. They
are designated WRITEREG [$CDCC](CDCC) and READREG [$CDDA](CDDA),
and they have the form shown above in the discussion of location 54784/$D600.
To store a value in any VDC register from BASIC, use:
<pre>
SYS DEC("CDCC"), value, register
</pre>
or
<pre>
SYS 52684, value, register
</pre>
where register is the number (0-36) of the internal VDC register you wish to access, and value is the value (0-255) you
wish to place in that register. If you have used any other
BANK statements in your program, it would be wise to add a
BANK 15 statement before these SYS statements to insure the
proper memory configuration.
To read the contents of an internal VDC register from
BASIC, use a statement of the form:
<pre>
SYS DEC("CDDA"),, register : RREG A
</pre>
or
<pre>
SYS 52698,, register : RREG A
</pre>
Be sure you have two commas between the SYS address and
the register number. After this statement has been executed,
the variable A will contain the value read from the specified
register. Again, if you change bank configurations elsewhere
in your program, it would be wise to add a BANK 15 before
the SYS statement.
