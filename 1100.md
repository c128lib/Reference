# BASIC Working Storage

## 4352-4400 $1100-$1130 DOSSTR <a name="1100"></a>
### DOS command assembly area
The BASIC statements that issue DOS commands - for example,
HEADER, COPY, CATALOG, and SCRATCH - use
this area to assemble the command string to be sent to the
disk drive.

## 4401-4402 $1131-$1132 XPOS <a name="1131"></a>
### Bitmapped-screen pixel-cursor horizontal position
These locations hold the horizontal (x) coordinate of the current
position of the pixel cursor on the bitmapped screen. The
range of values here depends on the scale factor currently in
use. If scaling is not used, the value can be found in the range
0-319. In any case, a value of zero specifies the left edge of
the screen. The value here is set to 0/$00 whenever the bitmapped
screen is cleared, either by the SCNCLR routine or by
adding the clear parameter to a GRAPHIC statement. After
execution of any BASIC graphic statement, this location will
hold the value of the final horizontal pixel position affected by
the operation. The value here can be set explicitly using the
LOCATE statement, which stores the specified horizontal position
in this location. If the DRAWTO form of the DRAW statement is used,
the line will begin at the horizontal position specified here.

## 4403-4404 $1133-$1134 YPOS XPOS <a name="1133"></a>
### Bitmapped-screen pixel-cursor vertical position
These locations hold the vertical (y) coordinate of the current
position of the pixel cursor on the bitmapped screen. The
range of values here depends on the scale factor currently in
use. If scaling is not used, the value can be found in the range
0-199. In any case, a value of zero specifies the top edge of
the screen. The value here is set to 0/$00 whenever the bitmapped
screen is cleared, either by the SCNCLR routine or by
adding the clear parameter to a GRAPHIC statement. After
execution of any BASIC graphic statement, this location will
hold the value of the final vertical pixel position affected by
the operation. The value here can be set explicitly using the
LOCATE statement, which stores the specified vertical position in
this location. If the DRAWTO form of the DRAW statement is used,
the line will begin at the vertical position specified here.

## 4405-4406 $1135-$1136 XDEST <a name="1135"></a>
### Final horizontal pixel position for graphics operations
These locations hold the calculated ending horizontal pixelcursor
position for BASIC graphics operations. The operation is
complete when the value in locations [$1131-$1132](#1131)
equals the value here.

## 4407-4408 $1137-$1138 YDEST <a name="1137"></a>
### Final vertical pixel position for graphics operations
These locations hold the calculated ending vertical pixel-cursor
position for BASIC graphics operations. The operation is complete
when the value in locations [$1133-$1134](#1134)
equals the value here.

## 4409-4455 $1139-$1167 <a name="1139"></a>
### Working storage for assorted graphics routines
BASIC graphics routines such as BOX, CIRCLE, DRAW, and
PAINT use various locations in this range to perform the calculations
necessary to plot the points for the figure being
drawn. The MOVSPR routine also uses some of these locations for sprite
position calculations in those cases where the
sprite is moved relative to the pixel cursor.

## 4456 $1168 CHRPAG <a name="1168"></a>
### Starting page for character pattern definitions
This location is used during the CHAR routine [$67D7](4000#67D7) in the
calculations to determine where character shapes are to be
placed on the bitmapped screen. The value here is the starting
page of character memory. This location will hold the value
from either [$11EC](#11EC) or [$11EB](#11EB).

## 4457 $1169 BITCNT <a name="1169"></a>
### Bit counter for shape retrieval
This location is used during the GSHAPE routine [$658D](4000#658D) as a
counter for the bits to be read from each byte of the storage
string.

## 4458 $116A SCALEM <a name="116A"></a>
### Scaling flag
This location indicates whether the scaling feature is to be
used when graphics are drawn on the bitmapped screen.
While this location contains 0/$00, scaling will not be used.
When the location contains any nonzero value, the horizontal
and vertical coordinates for all graphics routines will be scaled
according to the values in locations [$87-$88](0000#87) and
[$89-$8A](0000#89). This location is initialized to 0/$00 (scaling off)
during the BASIC cold-start sequence, and also whenever the
clear-screen parameter is included in a GRAPHIC
statement. The routine to execute the SCALE statement
[$6960](4000#6960) will store the first parameter following SCALE (0 or 1)
here.

## 4459 $116B WIDTH <a name="116B"></a>
### Line width for bitmapped graphics routines
The value here determines whether the lines drawn by BASIC
bitmapped graphics routines are to be standard width (indicated
when this location contains 0/$00) or double width (indicated
when this location contains any nonzero value). The
value here is initialized to 0/$00 (normal width) during the
BASIC cold-start sequence. The routine to execute the WIDTH
statement [$71B6](4000#71B6) will store the width parameter minus 1 in
this location.

## 4460 $116C FILFLG <a name="116C"></a>
### BOX fill flag
This location is used during the BOX routine [$62B7](4000#62B7) to specify
whether the shape is to be open or filled. If the value here is
0/$00 the shape will be open; otherwise, it will be filled. This
location is initialized to 0/$00 (open shapes) during the
BASIC cold-start sequence. When a BOX statement is executed,
the seventh parameter (paint) following the statement
will be copied here. If that parameter is omitted, it will default
to 0/$00.

## 4461 $116D BITMSK <a name="116D"></a>
### Bit mask value
This location is used as a mask value to select individual bits
during the DRAW and SPRDEF routines

## 4462 $116E NUMCNT <a name="116E"></a>
### Temporary storage for assorted routines
This location is used for temporary working storage during the
CHAR, MOVSPR, and SPRDEF routines.

## 4463 $116F TRCFLG <a name="116F"></a>
### Trace mode flag
This location is used to indicate whether BASIC is in trace
mode. When a program is executed in trace mode, the line
number of each program line is printed as it is executed. Trace
mode is off when bit 7 of this location is %0, and on when bit
7 is %1. This location is initialized to 0/$00 (trace off) during
the BASIC cold-start sequence. It is also reset to 0/$00 during
the NEW routine. The value here can be changed using the
TRON and TROFF statements. TRON sets this location to
255/$FF, and TROFF resets it to 0/$00.

## 4464-4467 $1170-$1173 RENUM-TMPS <a name="1170"></a>
### Working storage for RENUMBER
These locations are used for working storage during BASIC's
RENUMBER routine [$5AF8](4000#5AF8). Locations [$1170-$1171](#1170)
hold the line number at which renumbering is to begin, and
[$1172-$1173](#1172) hold the increment by which subsequent lines are
to be renumbered.

## 4468 $1174 T3 <a name="1174"></a>
### Loop counter for reading directory entries
Tris location is used during the CATALOG/DIRECTORY routine
[$A07E](4000#A07E) as a counter in the loop to discard extraneous
characters before the block count.

## 4469-4470 $1175-$1176 T4 <a name="1175"></a>
### Block count for directory entry
These locations are used during the CATALOG/DIRECTORY
routine [$A07E](4000#A07E) to hold the block count for each file entry
read from the drive.

## 4471 $1177 VTEMP3 <a name="1177"></a>
### Working storage for graphics parameter scaling
This location is used for working storage during the routine
that scales graphics parameters [$9DAE](4000#9DAE) when the SCALE
option is in effect.

## 4472 $1178 VTEMP4 <a name="1178"></a>
### Working storage for graphics parameter evaluation
This location is used during the routine that evaluates parameters
for graphics routines [$9E6D](4000#9E6D) to hold the offset to the
parameter being evaluated.

## 4473 $1179 VTEMP5 <a name="1179"></a>
### Working storage for graphics parameter evaluation
This location is used during the routine that evaluates parameters
for graphics routines [$9E6D](4000#9E6D) to hold a value indicating
the parameter type.

## 4474-4475 $117A-$117B ADRAYI <a name="117A"></a>
### Pointer to floating point-to-integer conversion routine
These locations point to the routine that converts the floatingpoint
value in FAC1 (99-103/$63-$67) into a two-byte integer
value in the accumulator (low byte) and Y register (high byte).
The BASIC cold-start sequence initializes the value here to
33951/$849F, the address of that routine in the current version of BASIC ROM.

This pointer is especially useful in conjunction with the
USR function. See the entry in Chapter 5 for details. To perform
this conversion, it's best to use the indirect JMP ($117A)
instead of the absolute JMP $849F. That way, your program
will still work if the ROM is revised in future versions.

## 4476-4477 $117C-$117D ADRAY2 <a name="117C"></a>
### Pointer to integer-to-floating point conversion routine
These locations point to the routine that converts a two-byte
integer value in the accumulator (low byte) and Y register (high
byte) to a floating-point value in FAC1 [$63-$67](0000#63).
The BASIC cold-start sequence initializes the value here to
31036/$793C, the address of that routine in the current version of BASIC ROM.

This pointer is especially useful in conjunction with the
USR function. To perform this conversion, it's best to use
the indirect JMP ($117F)
rather than the absolute JMP $793C. That way, your program
will still work if the ROM is revised in future versions

## 4478-4565 $117E-$11D5 SPRITE-DATA <a name="117E"></a>
### Sprite movement control data

The MOVSPR statement has an option to set sprites in motion
at a given angle and speed. These locations hold data concerning
sprite motion. For moving sprites, the values here will be
used to generate position values that will be copied to the
shadow registers at [$11D6-$11E6](#11D6). The locations are
used as follows:

||Sprite 0|Sprite 1|Sprite 2|Sprite 3|Sprite 4|Sprite 5|Sprite 6|Sprite 7|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Speed                      |4478/$117E|4489/$1189|4500/$1194|4511/$119F|4522/$11AA|4533/$11B5|4544/$11C0|4555/$11CB|
|Speed countdown            |4479/$117F|4490/$118A|4501/$1195|4512/$11A0|4523/$11AB|4534/$11B6|4545/$11C1|4556/$11CC|
|Direction                  |4480/$1180|4491/$118B|4502/$1196|4513/$11A1|4524/$11AC|4535/$11B7|4546/$11C2|4557/$11CD|
|Horizontal increment (low) |4481/$1181|4492/$118C|4503/$1197|4514/$11A2|4525/$11AD|4536/$11B8|4547/$11C3|4558/$11CE|
|                    (high) |4482/$1182|4493/$118D|4504/$1198|4515/$11A3|4526/$11AE|4537/$11B9|4548/$11C4|4559/$11CF|
|Vertical increment (low)   |4483/$1183|4494/$118E|4505/$1199|4516/$11A4|4527/$11AF|4538/$11BA|4549/$11C5|4560/$11D0|
|                    (high) |4484/$1184|4495/$118F|4506/$119A|4517/$11A5|4528/$11B0|4539/$11BB|4550/$11C6|4561/$11D1|
|Horizontal position (low)  |4485/$1185|4496/$1190|4507/$119B|4518/$11A6|4529/$11B1|4540/$11BC|4551/$11C7|4562/$11D2|
|                     (high)|4486/$1186|4497/$1191|4508/$119C|4519/$11A7|4530/$11B2|4541/$11BD|4552/$11C8|4563/$11D3|
|Vertical position (low)    |4487/$1187|4498/$1192|4509/$119D|4520/$11A8|4531/$11B3|4542/$11BE|4553/$11C9|4564/$11D4|
|                     (high)|4488/$1188|4499/$1193|4510/$119E|4521/$11A9|4532/$11B4|4543/$11BF|4554/$11CA|4565/$11D5|

In addition to using the MOVSPR routine, the values here
can be set directly to set a sprite in motion. (The corresponding
sprite must be enabled before the motion values have any
effect.) The speed value (0-15) determines how many times
per IRQ interrupt the horizontal and vertical increment values
will be applied to the horizontal and vertical position values.
If the speed value is 0/$00, the corresponding sprite will not
be moved. The speed value is copied to the countdown value
during each interrupt. The direction value can have one of the
following values:

|Direction value|Sprite motion|
|-|-|
|0|x increasing, y decreasing|
|1|x increasing, y increasing|
|2|x decreasing, y increasing|
|3|x decreasing, y decreasing|

All locations in this range are initialized to 0/$00 during
the BASIC cold-start sequence. The warm-start sequence performs the
less dramatic initialization step of resetting all the
speed locations to 0/$00, which stops all sprite motion.

## 4566-4582 $11D6-$11E6 VIC-SAVE <a name="11D6"></a>
### Shadows for VIC sprite position registers

The contents of these locations are copied into the VIC chip
sprite position registers ([$D000-$D010](D000#D000)) during
each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D](4000#A84D). As long as
the BASIC IRQ routine is active, the VIC registers cannot be
changed directly. Instead, you should store the desired register
value in the corresponding shadow location. All locations in
this range are initialized to 0/$00 during the BASIC cold-start
sequence. The values here can be set using the MOVSPR
statement. The MOVSPR routine [$6CC6](4000#6CC6) sets the value here
directly when a static sprite position is specified. When a moving sprite is specified, the movement information is stored in
the table at [$117E-$11D5](#117E) and the values here are
updated during each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine
[$A84D](4000#A84D). The locations are used as follows:

|Location|Register|Function|
|-|-|-|
|4566/$11D6|53248/$D000|Sprite 0 horizontal position|
|4567/$11D7|53249/$D001|Sprite 0 vertical position|
|4568/$11D8|53250/$D002|Sprite 1 horizontal position|
|4569/$11D9|53251/$D003|Sprite 1 vertical position|
|4570/$11DA|53252/$D004|Sprite 2 horizontal position|
|4571/$11DB|53253/$D005|Sprite 2 vertical position|
|4572/$11DC|53254/$D006|Sprite 3 horizontal position|
|4573/$11DD|53255/$D007|Sprite 3 vertical position|
|4574/$11DE|53256/$D008|Sprite 4 horizontal position|
|4575/$11DF|53257/$D009|Sprite 4 vertical position|
|4576/$11E0|53258/$D00A|Sprite 5 horizontal position|
|4577/$11E1|53259/$D00B|Sprite 5 vertical position|
|4578/$11E2|53260/$D00C|Sprite 6 horizontal position|
|4579/$11E3|53261/$D00D|Sprite 6 vertical position|
|458O/$11E4|53262/$D00E|Sprite 7 horizontal position|
|4581/$11E5|53263/$D00F|Sprite 7 vertical position|
|4582/$11E6|53264/$D010|Most significant bits of horizontal position|

## 4583-4584 $11E7-$11E8 <a name="11E7"></a>
### Shadows for VIC sprite-collision registers

During any pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D](4000#A84D)
where either or both of the sprite-collision latch flags (bits 1-2
of [$D019](D000#D019)) are found to be set to %1, the contents of
the corresponding VIC chip sprite-collision register will be recorded
in these locations. For sprite-foreground collisions (indicated when
bit 1 of the flag is set), any bits in the register at
[$D01F](D000#D01F) which are set to %1 will also be set to %1
in location $11E8. Likewise, for sprite-sprite collisions (indicated
when bit 2 of the flag is set), the %1 bits in the register
at [$D01E](D000#D01E) will be recorded in location $11E7.

Thus, these locations will accumulate collision readings until
they are cleared, rather than simply holding the most recent
collision values. The routine for the BASIC function BUMP
[$837C](4000#837C) returns values based on the contents of these locations,
rather than on the actual register contents. BUMP(1) returns
the sprite-sprite collision value in $11E7, and
BUMP(2) returns the sprite-foreground collision value in
$11E8. Either location will be reset to 0/$00 after being
read by BUMP. Both locations are also initialized to 0/$00
during the BASIC cold-start sequence.

## 4585-4586 $11E9-$11EA <a name="11E9"></a>
### Shadow for VIC light pen registers
During any pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D](4000#A84D)
where the light pen latch flag (bit 3 of [$D019](D000#D019)) is found
to be set to %1, the contents of the VIC chip light pen registers at
[$D013-$D014](D000#D013) will be copied into these
locations. The routine for the BASIC function PEN [$82AE](4000#82AE)
returns values based on the contents of these locations, rather
than on the actual register contents. PEN(0) returns the value
in $11E9, multiplied by 2. PEN(1) returns the value in
$11EA. Either location will be reset to 0/$00 after being
read by PEN. Both of these locations are also initialized to
0/$00 during the BASIC cold-start sequence.

## 4587 $11EB UPPER_LOWER <a name="11EB"></a>
### Starting page for alternate character set during CHAR
The value here determines the starting page in system memory for
the alternate set of characters used during the CHAR
statement for bitmapped screens (see location 4588/$11EC for
more information). CHAR will always begin using the character set
pointed to in location 4588/$11EC. To switch to the alternate character
set, the CHAR string must include character
code 14/$0E. Character code 142/$8E switches back to the
default set. This location is initialized to 216/$D8 during
BASIC cold start. That value selects the ROM lowercase/
uppercase set at 55296/$D800 as the alternate character pattern source.
If you use a custom character set, you can change
the value here to have CHAR use your new characters. However,
the new character set must be visible in the bank 14
memory configuration, since that is how the system will be
configured when character pattern data is read.

## 4588 $11EC UPPER_GRAPHIC <a name="11EC"></a>
### Starting page for default character set during CHAR
The value here determines the starting page in system memory for the
default set of characters used during the CHAR
statement. The value here doesn't affect any statement other
than CHAR, and is used only when character shapes are being
placed on a bitmapped screen. (When CHAR is used to place
characters on the text screen, the screen editor printing routines
are used instead.) For bitmapped screens, CHAR will always
begin using the character set pointed to here, regardless of the
character set in use on the text screen. To switch to the alternate
character set (starting page in 4587/$11EB), the CHAR
string must include character code 14/$0E. Character code
142/$8E switches back to the character set pointed to here.
Thus, it is possible to mix the two character sets in a single
CHAR statement. This location is initialized to 208/$D0 during
BASIC cold start. That value makes the ROM uppercase/
graphics set at 53248/$D000 the default character pattern
source. If you use a custom character set, you can change the
value here to have CHAR use your new characters. However,
the new character set must be visible in the bank 14 memory
configuration, since that is how the system will be configured
when character pattern data is read.

## 4589 $11ED DOSSA <a name="11ED"></a>
### Channel number for BASIC relative file operations
The channel number (secondary address) for BASIC relative
file operations is stored in this location.

## 4590-4607 $11EE-$11FF Unused <a name="11EE"></a>
None of these locations is used by any system ROM routine.
