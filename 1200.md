# $1200-$12FF - BASIC General-Purpose Working Storage

## 4608-4609 $1200-$1201 OLDLIN <a name="1200"></a>
### Line number where program stopped
Whenever a BASIC program stops because of an END or
STOP statement, or because the end of the program has been
reached, or because the RUN/STOP key has been pressed,
then the STOP/END routine [$4BCB](4000#4BCB) will be executed. That
routine stores the line number where the program stopped in
this pair of locations (in low-byte/high-byte format). The
CONT routine [$5A60](4000#5A60) uses the value here to determine where
to restart the program. These locations are also used for temporary
storage during the RENUMBER routine [$5AF8](4000#5AF8).

## 4610-4611 $1202-$1203 OLDTXT <a name="1202"></a>
### Pointer to the start of current line
Each time a BASIC program line is executed, the address of
the first character of program text in the line is stored in these
locations. The high byte ($1203) is also used as a flag to
indicate whether the program can continue after being halted.
The CONT routine [$5A60](4000#5A60) will give a CAN'T CONTINUE error
message if the flag byte is 0/$00. The flag location is initialized to
0/$00 during the CLR routine [$51F8](4000#51F8)-you can't
CONTinue a program before it is run. If the program halts without errors,
the flag location will hold the high byte of the address of the line
where the program stopped, which will always
be nonzero, so the program can be CONTinued. However, if
the program stopped because of an error, or if any lines are
changed after the program has stopped, then the flag location
will be reset to zero and the program cannot be CONTinued.

## 4612-4615 $1204-$1207 PUCHRS <a name="1204"></a>
### Character definitions for PRINT USING
The values in these locations determine which characters will
be used for the redefinable characters in the PRINT USING
format. The default values are copied from locations $5250-
$5253 in BASIC ROM during the CLR routine, so the default
definitions will be restored each time a program is run. In
BASIC, the definitions here can be changed using the PUDEF
statement.

**$1204**: This location holds the filler character for the pattern,
the one which will be used to fill unused positions in the
format. The default value is 32/$20, the space character.

**$1205**: This location holds the comma character for the
pattern. The character with the code specified here will be
substituted wherever a comma appears in the PRINT USING
format. The default value is 44/$2C, the comma character.

**$1206**: This location holds the decimal point character for
the pattern. The character with the code specified here will be
substituted wherever a decimal point (period) appears in the
PRINT USING format. The default value is 46/$2E, the period
( . ) character.

**$1207**: This location holds the monetary symbol character for the
pattern. The character with the code specified here
will be substituted wherever a dollar sign ($) appears in the
PRINT USING format. The default value is 36/$24, the dollar
sign character.

## 4616 $1208 ERRNUM <a name="1208"></a>
### Number of most recent error
Whenever a BASIC error occurs, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C)
stores the error number here. The reserved variable ER always
reflects the value in this location. Refer to the entry for the error
message table [$484B](4000#484B) for a complete list of
error numbers. Once an error number is stored here, the value
is retained until another error occurs or until the location is
reinitialized. This location is initialized to 255/$FF during CLR
[$51F8](4000#51F8) (also executed as part of NEW and RUN). This setting
results in a value of -1 in the reserved variable ER, so when
ER contains that value no error has yet occurred.

## 4617-4618 $ 1209-$120A ERRLIN <a name="1209"></a>
### Line number where most recent error occurred
Whenever a BASIC error occurs, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C)
checks the run mode flag (127/$7F) to see if the error occurred
in a program line or an immediate mode line. If the error was
in a program line, the current line number is copied
here from locations 59-60/$3B-$3C. The reserved variable EL
always reflects the value in these locations. Once a line number
is stored here, it will be retained until another error occurs
or until the locations are reinitialized. These locations are
initialized to 65535/$FFFF during CLR [$51F8](4000#51F8) (also executed as
part of NEW and RUN). Thus, when the reserved variable EL
contains 65535 no error has yet occurred.

## 4619-4620 $120B-$120C TRAPNO <a name="120B"></a>
### Target line number for TRAP statement
When error trapping is enabled with the TRAP statement, the
target line number to which the program will be directed
when an error occurs is stored here (in standard lowbyte/high-byte order).
Location 4620/$120C is also used as a
flag to determine whether trapping is enabled. The flag location is
initialized to 255/$FF during CLR (which is also part of
NEW and RUN). Since the high bytes of all valid line numbers are less
than 255/$FF, trapping is considered disabled as
long as the flag location contains that value. When trapping is
enabled, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C) will transfer control to
the line number indicated here whenever a BASIC error occurs.

## 4621 $120D TMPTRP <a name="120D"></a>
### Temporary storage for high byte of TRAP line number
When an error is trapped to a specified line, the ERROR routine
[$4D3C](4000#4D3C) copies the high byte of the target line number
from 4620/$120C into this location, then stores the value
255/$FF in 4620/$120C. This disables the trapping of errors
during the error-handling routine, which would otherwise put
the program into an infinite loop. The value here is copied
back into 4620/$120C during execution of the RESUME statement
[$5F62](4000#5F62).


## 4622-4623 $120E-$120F ERRTXT <a name="120E"></a>
### Pointer to start of statement where last error occurred
Whenever an error occurs, the ERROR routine [$4D3C](4000#4D3C) copies
the value in 4610-4611/$1202-$1203 into these locations.
The HELP subroutine that highlights the portion of the line
where the error occurred uses the value here to determine
where to begin the highlighting. The RESUME routine [$5F62](4000#5F62)
uses the value here to determine where to resume execution.

## 4624-4625 $1210-$1211 TEXT_TOP <a name="1210"></a>
### End-of-program pointer
These locations contain the address of the location immediately
following the end of BASIC program text. The NEW
statement [$51D6] initializes the value here to two bytes beyond
the address in the start-of-program pointer (45-46/
$2D-$2E). The value here is updated to reflect the new ending
address whenever a line is added or deleted from the program.
An OUT OF MEMORY error occurs if the value here ever exceeds
the value in [$1212-$1213](#1212). Following a
LOAD or DLOAD, these locations are set to one byte beyond
the last location to which data was loaded. For a SAVE or
DSAVE, the value here determines the last address from
which data will be saved.

## 4626-4627 $1212-$1213 MAX_MEM_O <a name="1212"></a>
### Top-of-BASIC pointer
The value in this pair of locations determines the top of free
memory in block 0 RAM. The address will be one location beyond
the highest one available for BASIC program text. An
OUT OF MEMORY error will occur when the value in locations
[$1210-$1211](#1210) exceeds the value here. The
BASIC cold-start initialization subroutine [$4045](4000#4045) writes the
value 65280/$FF00 here, so that all block 0 RAM below the
MMU registers is available for program text. You can reserve
an area at the top of program memory by reducing the value
in these locations. Unlike some of the other pointers, you need
only store the new value here; no subsequent NEW or CLR is
required.

## 4628-4629 $1214-$1215 TMPTXT <a name="1214"></a>
### Temporary text pointer storage for DO
This pair of locations is used to temporarily hold the CHRGET
text pointer value (from 61-62/$3D-$3E) during execution of
the DO statement [$5FE0](4000#5FE0).

## 4630-4631 $1216-$1217 TMPLIN <a name="1216"></a>
### Temporary line number storage for DO
This pair of locations is used to temporarily hold the current
line number value (from 59-60/$3B-$3C) during execution of
the DO statement [$5FE0](4000#5FE0).

## 4632-4634 $1218-$121A USRPOK <a name="1218"></a>
### USR function jump vector
The BASIC function USR calls a machine language routine,
like SYS, but it also allows a numeric value to be passed to
and from the ML routine. The routine in BASIC ROM that executes USR
ends with a JMP $1218. Location 4632/$1218
contains 76/$4C, the machine language JMP instruction. Locations
4633-4634/$1219-$121A should contain the address of
the target machine language routine (in the usual lowbyte/high-byte
format). You must explicitly load these locations with the address of
the target routine before you use
USR. This location is initialized to 32040/$7D28 during
BASIC cold start. This is the address of the routine that issues
the ILLEGAL QUANTITY ERROR message, which is what
you'll get if you use USR without changing locations
4633-4634/$1219-$121A. Refer to Chapter 5 for more information on passing
values to and from the called routine.

## 4635-4639 $121B-$121F RNDX <a name="121B"></a>
### Random number seed value
This five-byte area holds the seed value for BASIC's
randomnumber-generator routine [$8434](4000#8434). When a positive argument
is supplied, the RND routine generates the next random number by
performing calculations and manipulations with the
value here. The generated values aren't really random-any
given seed value here will always produce the same result.
However, the process is sufficiently complicated that the results
aren't easily predictable. Whenever any random number
is generated, the resulting value is stored here for possible use
as the seed for the next random number. Location 4635/$121B
is initialized to 0/$00 during the BASIC cold-start routine.
That is a change from previous Commodore models, where all
five bytes of the seed value were initialized. The zero byte has
the effect of making the initial seed value 0, so the first random
number value generated after the computer is turned on
or after a reset will always be 1.07870447E-03.

## 4640 $1220 CIRCLE_SEGMENT <a name="1220"></a>
### Degrees between segments for CIRCLE routine
This location is used during the BASIC CIRCLE statement routine
[$668E](4000#668E) to hold the number of degrees to turn for each
segment of the circle. The value here is set from the ninth parameter
in the CIRCLE statement, and defaults to 2 if that parameter is omitted.

## 4641 $1221 DEJAVU1 <a name="1221"></a>
Although Commodore literature states that this location holds
a value relating to the reset status, no reference to this location
occurs in any ROM routine.

## 4642 $1222 TEMPO_RATE <a name="1222"></a>
### Tempo setting for PLAY statement
The value here determines the tempo for notes played by the
BASIC PLAY statement. The value here is subtracted from the
sound duration value for each voice (in locations 4643-4648/
$1223-$1228) during each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine. The larger
the value here, the faster the duration decreases and the faster each
note plays. The value here is
initialized to 16/$10 during the SID initialization routine
[$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold start and warm start sequences.
In BASIC, the TEMPO statement can be used to
change the value here.

## 4643-4648 $1223-$1228 VOICES <a name="1223"></a>
### Durations for currently active notes
These locations hold the durations of the current PLAY statement notes
for each of the SID chip voices:
* Voice 0: 4643-4644/$1223-$1224
* Voice 1: 4645-4646/$1225-$1226
* Voice 2: 4647-4648/$1227-$1228

**Bit 7** of each of the high bytes (4644/$1224, 4646/$1226, and
4648/$1228) is used to indicate whether a note is currently
being played by that voice. The voice is active when that bit is
%0. The duration value for each active voice is decremented
by the tempo value specified in location 4642/$1222 during
each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D](4000#A84D). When a
duration is decremented below $0000, the high byte will roll
over to $FF, which will set bit 7 to %1, marking the end of the
note. At this point, the gate bit for the voice will be turned off,
stopping sound output for that voice. Large tempo values
cause the value here to decrease more rapidly, increasing the
speed at which notes are played, while small tempo values increase the note time.
The high bytes for all three voices are set to 255/$FF by
the SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC
cold start and warm start sequences. This makes all voices initially inactive.
When the PLAY statement plays a note, the duration for that note will be
copied from 4649-4650/$1229-$122A
into the slot for the voice specified for that note.

## 4649-4650 $1229-$122A NTIME <a name="1229"></a>
### Duration of current note
When the PLAY statement prepares a note, the duration for
the note is first calculated in this location, then transferred to
the proper slot in 4643-4648/$1223-$1228. The value here is
set to 288/$0120, the value for a quarter note, by the SID initialization
routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold start
and warm start sequences.

## 4651 $122B OCTAVE <a name="122B"></a>
### Octave for current note
The value in this location determines the octave for the current notes
played by the PLAY statement. This value will affect the calculation
of the frequency for the notes. The value
here is set to 4/$04, the octave containing middle C, by the
SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold
start and warm start sequences. The octave value here remains
in effect until changed by an 0 parameter in the PLAY string.

## 4652 $122C SHARP <a name="122C"></a>
### Sharp/flat flag
The value in this location holds a value that indicates whether
the current note will be either sharp or flat. The location normally
holds 0/$00 for natural notes. When a # character is
found in the PLAY string, this location will be set to 1/$01 to
indicate that the next note should be sharp. When a $ character is
found in the string, this location will be set to 255/$FF
to indicate that the next note should be flat.

## 4653-4654 $122D-$122E PITCH <a name="122D"></a>
### Frequency for current note
When the PLAY statement prepares a note, the frequency for
the note is calculated in these locations before being transferred
into the SID chip registers for the specified voice. The
frequency is calculated by loading a base frequency for the
specified note from the table at 28665-28688/$6FF9-$7010,
adjusted for the octave specified in 4651/$122B. If the flag at
4652/$122C indicates that the note is to be sharp or flat, the
frequency is adjusted accordingly.

## 4655 $122F VOICE <a name="122F"></a>
### Voice number for current note
The value in this location specifies which voice will be used to
play the next note. The value here is set to 0/$00 by the SID
initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold start
and warm start sequences. This selects voice 0 as the default
voice. The value here will remain in effect until changed by a
V parameter in the PLAY string. The parameter value will be
reduced by 1 to convert the BASIC voice number (1-3) to a
VIC voice number (0-2).

## 4656-4658 $1230-$1232 WAVE <a name="1230"></a>
### Waveforms for current notes
The values in these locations determine which waveforms will
be used for each of the three voices:
* Voice 0: 4656/$1230
* Voice 1: 4657/$1231
* Voice 2: 4658/$1232

These locations hold the waveform value for the instrument
specified for the voice. All three voices are initialized to the
default value for instrument O. This selects a default pulse
waveform for all three voices. The value here remains in effect
until changed by a T parameter in the PLAY string. The T parameter
causes the value for the current voice to be changed to
the waveform value for the specified instrument from the table
at 4671-4720/$123F-$1270.

## 4659 $1233 DNOTE <a name="1233"></a>
### Dotted-note flag
The value in this location determines whether the next note
will be normal or "dotted." Dotted notes play Ph times as
long as a standard note. This location normally holds 0/$00,
but will be set to 35/$23 if a period (.) is found in the play
string. In this case, the duration of the next note will be increased
by 50 percent.

## 4660-4663 $1234-$1237 FILTSAV <a name="1234"></a>
### Temporary storage for filter parameters
The filter parameters are copied here from 4721-4722/
$1271-$1272 at the beginning of the FILTER statement routine
[$7046](4000#7046).
The filter parameter manipulations are then performed on these
locations, and the results are copied back to
the working storage area.

## 4664 $1238 FLTFLG <a name="1238"></a>
### Filter type index
This location is used as a mask value to select individual filter
control bits when evaluating the FILTER statement parameters.

## 4665 $1239 NIBBLE <a name="1239"></a>
### Temporary storage
This location is used as working storage by the FILTER and
ENVELOPE routines.

## 4666 $123A TONNUM <a name="123A"></a>
### Current instrument number
This location will hold the instrument number specified in the
most recent ENVELOPE statement.

## 4667-4669 $123B-$123D TONVAL <a name="123B"></a>
### Envelope parameters for current instrument
The current parameters for the specified instrument are read
from the instrument table into these locations at the beginning
of the ENVELOPE routine [$70C1](4000#70C1):
* Attack/decay: 4667/$123B
* Sustain/release: 4668/$123C
* Waveform: 4669/$123D

If the ENVELOPE statement specifies new values for any of
these parameters, the new values replace the original values
here. The values here are then copied back into the table entries
for the specified instrument number.

## 4670 $123E PARCNT <a name="123E"></a>
### Index into instrument table for current instrument
This value is used during the ENVELOPE routine [$70C1](4000#70C1) to
hold the index to the current set of instrument parameters.

## 4671-4720 $123F-$1270 <a name="123F"></a>
### Instrument parameter tables
This area is used to hold the envelope parameters for the ten
defined instruments supported by the PLAY statement [$6DE1](4000#6DE1):

|Instrument|Attack/Decay|Sustain/Release|Waveform|Pulsewidth low byte|Pulsewidth high byte|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|0|4671/$123F|4681/$1249|4691/$1253|4701/$125D|4711/$1267|
|1|4672/$1240|4682/$124A|4692/$1254|4702/$125E|4712/$1268|
|2|4673/$1241|4683/$124B|4693/$1255|4703/$125F|4713/$1269|
|3|4674/$1242|4684/$124C|4694/$1256|4704/$1260|4714/$126A|
|4|4675/$1243|4685/$124D|4695/$1257|4705/$1261|4715/$126B|
|5|4676/$1244|4686/$124E|4696/$1258|4706/$1262|4716/$126C|
|6|4677/$1245|4687/$124F|4697/$1259|4707/$1263|4717/$126D|
|7|4678/$1246|4688/$1250|4698/$125A|4708/$1264|4718/$126E|
|8|4679/$1247|4689/$1251|4699/$125B|4709/$1265|4719/$126F|
|9|4680/$1248|4690/$1252|4700/$125C|4710/$1266|4720/$1270|

All three voices are initially assigned the envelope parameters
for instrument O. These settings remain in effect until changed
with a T parameter in the PLAY string.

The values for any table entry can be changed using the
ENVELOPE statement. Default instrument table values are
copied into this area from a table in ROM at 28689-28728/
$7011-$7038 during the SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part
of both the BASIC cold start and warm start sequences. The
default values are as follows:

|Envelope|Attack/Decay|Sustain/Release|Waveform|Pulsewidth|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|0 (piano)|9/$09|0/$00|65/$41 (pulse)|1791/$06FF|
|1 (accordion)|192/$C0|192/$C0|33/$21 (sawtooth)|0/$0000|
|2 (calliope)|0/$00|240/$F0|17/$11 (triangle)|255/$00FF|
|3 (drum)|5/$05|80/$50|129/$81 (noise)|0/$0000|
|4 (flute)|148/$94|64/$40|17/$11 (triangle)|255/$00FF
|5 (guitar)|9/$09|33/$21|33/$21 (sawtooth)|0/$0000|
|6 (harpsichord)|9/$09|0/$00|65/$41 (pulse)|767/$02FF|
|7 (organ)|9/$09|144/$90|65/$41 (pulse)|2048/$0800|
|8 (trumpet)|137/$89|65/$41|65/$41 (pulse)|767/$02FF|
|9 (xylophone)|9/$09|0/$00|17/$11 (triangle)|0/$0000|

Note that the pulsewidth values here are different from those
specified in Commodore literature. The official values assume
that all pulsewidth low bytes will be 0/$00. However, these
bytes are not explicitly initialized, so they will hold their
previous values after a reset. On power on, alternating pulsewidth
low-byte locations will hold 255/$FF instead of 0/$00.

## 4721-4722 $1271-$1272 FILTERS <a name="1271"></a>
### Current filter cutoff frequency
These locations hold the current cutoff frequency register setting,
an 11-bit value divided among the two locations with
bits 0-2 of the value in location 4721/$1271 and bits 3-10 of
the value in location 4722/$1272. The value is copied to the
SID cutoff frequency registers ([$D415-$D416](D400#D415))
when the X1 parameter is included in the PLAY string.

## 4723 $1273 <a name="1273"></a>
### Current filter control and resonance setting
**Bits 0-3** of this location determine which voices will be filtered
and **bits 4-7** control the filter resonance setting. The resonance
setting can be changed using the FILTER statement. When an
X1 parameter is included in the PLAY string, the filter control
bit in this location corresponding to the current voice will be
set to %1 and the value here will be copied into the SID register
at [$D417](D400#D417) to enable filtering of that voice. When an
X0 parameter is included, the corresponding voice bit will be
set to %0 and the value will again be copied to the SID register
to turn off filtering for that voice.

## 4724 $1274 <a name="1274"></a>
### Current filter type selection
**Bits 4-6** of this location determine the type of filtering
currently enabled. The setting of those bits can be changed using
the FILTER statement. Because the SID register that controls
filter type also controls volume, bits 0-3 of this location reflect
the current volume setting as well. When an Xl parameter is
included in a PLAY string, the value here is copied into the
SID register at [$D418](D400#D418) to enable the specified filter type.
This location is set to 15/$0F, the value for all filters off and
maximum volume, during the SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112),
part of both the BASIC cold start and warm start sequences.

## 4725 $1275 <a name="1275"></a>
### Current SID chip volume setting
**Bits 0-3** of this location reflect the current volume setting for
the SID chip. The value here can be changed either with the
VOL statement or with the U parameter in a PLAY string. Because
the SID register which controls volume also controls filter type
selection, **bits 4-6** of this location will reflect filter
type as well. The value here is set to 15/$0F, the value for
maximum volume, during the SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112),
part of both the BASIC cold start and warm start sequences.

## 4726-4728 $1276-$1278 INT_TRIP_FLAG <a name="1276"></a>
### Collision flags
The VIC internal interrupt register ([$D019](D000#D019)) is read
during each pass through the BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D](4000#A84D) to
determine if a sprite collision has occurred or if a new light pen
value has been latched. Because that register is automatically
cleared after a read, the system uses these locations to record
which conditions were detected:

|Location|Collision type|
|-|-|
|$1276|Sprite-sprite collision|
|$1277|Sprite-foreground collision|
|$1278|Light pen latch|

If a collision has occurred, the corresponding flag location will
be set to 255/$FF, but only if the collision type has been enabled
by setting to %1 the appropriate bit in location
[$127F](#127F). All three of these locations are set to 0/$00 during the
SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112), part of both the BASIC cold
start and warm start sequences. A location set to 255/$FF will
be reset to 0/$00 after COLLISION processing in the GONE
routine [$4A9F](4000#4A9F).

## 4729-4734 $1279-$127E INT_ADR <a name="1279"></a>
### Target line numbers for COLLISION
If the trapping of sprite collisions or light pen latches is
enabled, a BASIC subroutine will be called (effectively a GOSUB)
whenever one of the selected events occurs. These locations
are used to hold the number (in low-byte/high-byte integer
format) of the starting BASIC program line of the subroutine
to be called. (The subroutine should end with a RETURN
statement.) The values here can be set with the COLLISION
statement.
|Low byte|High byte|Collision type|
|-|-|-|
|4729/$1279|4732/$127C|sprite-sprite|
|4730/$127A|4733/$1270|sprite-foreground|
|4731/$127B|4734/$127E|light pen|

## 4735 $127F INTVAL <a name="127F"></a>
### Collision enable flag
**Bits 0-2** of this location indicate the collision types for which
trapping is currently enabled:

|Bit|Collision type|
|-|-|
|0|sprite-sprite|
|1|sprite-foreground|
|2|light pen|

Trapping is enabled if the bit is set to %1. Enabling trapping
will allow the corresponding collision type to be recorded in
the flags at [$1276-$1278](1276). **Bits 3-7** of this location
are unused. The value here is reset to 0/$00 during the BASIC
cold-start sequence. This disables all COLLISION branching.

## 4736 $1280 COLTYP <a name="1280"></a>
### Collision type index
The value here is used during the COLLISION routine [$7164](4000#7164)
to hold an index into the line number table at 4729-4734/
[$1279-$127E](1279).

## 4737 $1281 SOUND_VOICE <a name="1281"></a>
### Voice for current SOUND statement
The value in this location specifies which group of entries in
the following table should be loaded with the current SOUND
parameters. The value here is set to the value of the first
parameter in the SOUND statement, minus 1 to convert the
BASIC voice number (1-3) into a SID voice number (0-2).

## 4738-4770 $1282-$12A2 <a name="1282"></a>
### Table of SOUND statement settings
These locations hold the current SOUND parameters for the
three SID chip voices:

|Parameter|Voice 0|Voice 1|Voice 2|
|-|-|-|-|
|Duration (low)|4738/$1282|4739/$1283|4740/$1284|
|Duration (high)|4741/$1285|4742/$1286|4743/$1287|
|Frequency (low)|4744/$1288|4745/$1289|4746/$128A|
|Frequency (high)|4747/$128B|4748/$128C|4749/$128D|
|Minimum frequency (low)|4750/$128E|4751/$128F|4752/$1290|
|Minimum frequency (high)|4753/$1291|4754/$1292|4755/$1293|
|Step direction|4756/$1294|4757/$1295|4758/$1296|
|Step size (low)|4759/$1297|4760/$1298|4761/$1299|
|Step size (high)|4762/$129A|4763/$129B|4764/$129C|
|Current frequency (low)|4765/$129D|4766/$129E|4767/$129F|
|Current frequency (high)|4768/$12A0|4769/$12A1|4770/$12A2|

**Bit 7** of each of the duration high-byte values (locations
4741-4743/$1285-$1287) is used to indicate whether any
SOUND statement is active for the corresponding voice. If the
bit is %0, the voice is assumed to have an active sound, and
the current frequency value for the voice will be copied into
the SID chip frequency registers during each pass through the
BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D](4000#A84D). Also during each
pass through the interrupt routine, the duration value
for each active voice will be decremented. When the value is
decremented below $0000, the high byte will roll over to
255/$FF, setting bit 7 to %1, which marks the end of the
sound. At this point the gate bit for the voice will be set to %0
to turn off the sound.

Each of the duration high-byte locations will be set to
255/$FF during the SID initialization routine, part of both the
BASIC cold start and warm start sequences. This will turn off
SOUND output for all three voices. The values in these locations
are updated when the contents of 4771-4776/$12A3-$12A8
are copied to the entries for the specified voice during execution
of the SOUND statement [$71EC](4000#71EC).

## 4771-4776 $12A3-$12A8 <a name="12A3"></a>
### Parameters for most recent SOUND statement
These locations are used to assemble the parameters for the
current SOUND statement. The SOUND statement must include
voice number, frequency, and duration parameters. The
remaining parameters are optional; if they are omitted, default
values are supplied. The base frequency value is initialized to
the specified starting frequency. The locations and default
values are as follows:

|Parameter|Locations|Default value|
|-|-|-|
|Duration|4771-4772/$12A3-$12A4||
|Frequency|4773-4774/$12A5-$12A6||
|Minimum frequency|4775-4776/$12A7-$12A8|0/$0000|
|Step direction|4777/$12A9|0/$00 (sweep up)|
|Step size|4778-4779/$12AA-$12AB|0/$0000 (no sweep)|
|Base frequency|4780-4781/$12AC-$12AD||
|Pulsewidth|4782-4783/$12AE-$12AF|2048/$0800|
|Waveform|4784/$12B0|2/$02 (pulse)|

After all the parameters for a SOUND statement have
been evaluated and assembled here, the values are transferred
to the entries in the table at [$1282-$12A2](#1282) for the
specified voice. The base frequency value is used as the
beginning current frequency value.

## 4785 $12B1 POT_TEMP_1 <a name="12B1"></a>
### Temporary storage for POT and PEN routines
This location is used as temporary storage during the routines
to perform the BASIC functions POT [$824D](4000#824D) and PEN
[$82AE](4000#82AE).

## 4786 $12B2 POT_TEMP_2 <a name="12B2"></a>
### Temporary storage for POT routine
During execution of the POT function routine [$824D](4000#824D), the
potentiometer reading from the SID chip register is stored here
temporarily while the paddle buttons are being read.

## 4787-4790 $12B3-$12B6 WINDOW_TEMPS <a name="12B3"></a>
### Temporary parameter storage for WINDOW statement
When the WINDOW statement [$72CC](4000#72CC) is executed, the
parameter values associated with the statement are stored in
these locations before the screen editor WINDOW routine
[$C02D](C000#C02D) is called to actually set the new window margins.

|Location|Parameter|
|-|-|
|4787/$12B3|left column|
|4788/$12B4|top row|
|4789/$12B5|right column|
|4790/$12B6|bottom row|

## 4791-4806 $12B7-$12C6 <a name="12B7"></a>
### Filename buffer for DOS support commands
The routine which handles the BASIC 7.0 DOS support commands
such as SCRATCH and RENAME copies the filename
portion of the command here temporarily while the remainder
of the command is being processed. Once the command is set
up, the filename here is copied into the DOS command buffer
at [$1100-$112F](1100#1100)

## 4791-4853 $12B7-$12F5 SAVRAM <a name="12B7"></a>
### Sprite pattern storage
These locations are used during the SPRDEF statement routine
[$7372](4000#7372) to hold the original sprite pattern while a sprite is
being defined. If the STOP key is pressed to cancel the current
modifications, the pattern definition here will be restored to
the definition area for the sprite. The first 63 of these locations
are also used during the SPRSAV routine [$76EC](4000#76EC) to hold the
sprite pattern to be transferred to a string variable.

## 4854-4857 $12F6-$12F9 <a name="12F6"></a>
### Sprite pattern suffix
During the SPRSAV routine [$76EC](4000#76EC), these locations are
initialized with the pattern $17 $00 $14 $00. When a sprite pattern
is saved in a string variable, these bytes are appended to
the sprite pattern in [$12B7-$12F5](#12B7) before the data
is transferred to the string pool. Two bytes are needed as the
tag for the variable, but exactly what this four-byte pattern is
intended to achieve is unclear.

## 4858 $12FA DEFMOD <a name="12FA"></a>
### Sprite mode indicator for SPRDEF
This location is used during the SPRDEF statement routine
[$7372](4000#7372) to hold a value indicating the mode of the
sprite currently being defined. A value here of 0/$00 indicates
a standard sprite, while a value of 128/$80 indicates a multicolor
sprite.

## 4859 $12FB LINCNT <a name="12FB"></a>
### Sprite pattern line count for SPRDEF
This location is used during the SPRDEF statement routine
[$7372](4000#7372) to hold the number of the vertical line (0-20) within
the sprite pattern which is currently being defined.

## 4860 $12FC SPRITE_NUMBER <a name="12FC"></a>
### Sprite number for SPRDEF
This location is used during the SPRDEF statement routine
[$7372](4000#7372) to hold the number (0-7) of the sprite currently being
defined.

## 4861 $12FD IRQ_WRAP_FLAG <a name="12FD"></a>
### BASIC IRQ activity flag
This location is tested at the beginning of the BASIC IRQ service
routine [$A84D](4000#A84D). If it contains any nonzero value, the
routine exits immediately. The location is initialized to 0/$00
during the SID initialization routine [$4112](4000#4112). The BASIC IRQ
routine increments this location (to 1/$01) when it begins, so
the test prevents the routine from being restarted if another
interrupt occurs before the current pass is completed. The IRQ
routine resets the value here to 0/$00 before exiting.

The BASIC portion of the IRQ sequence is responsible for
moving sprites, detecting sprite collisions, and handling the
BASIC sound statements. The routine maintains a number of
shadow locations which are copied into VIC and SID chip
hardware registers during each interrupt. Sometimes you may
want to turn off these shadow locations to have direct access
to the hardware registers. One way to do that is to store some
nonzero value in this location. While turning off the BASIC
IRQ routine will give you direct access to the hardware registers,
you should keep in mind that it will also effectively disable
the BASIC statements MOVSPR, COLLISION, SOUND,
and PLAY.

## 4862-4863 $12FE-$12FF Unused <a name="12FE"></a>
These locations are not used by any 128 ROM routine
