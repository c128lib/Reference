## 53248-53264 $D000-$D010 Sprite horizontal and vertical position registers <a name="D000"></a>

The position of each sprite is controlled by a pair of these registers
plus a bit in the register at [53264/$D010](#D010). The extra bit
is required because the horizontal position value can exceed 255.
The extra bit is effectively the ninth (most significant) bit
of the horizontal position register. The relationship of registers
to sprites is as follow:

|Sprite |Horizontal register | Bit in $D010| Vertical register|
|-|-|-|-|
|0| 53248/$D000| 0|53249/$D001|
|1| 53250/$D002| 1|53251/$D003|
|2| 53252/$D004| 2|53253/$D005|
|3| 53254/$D006| 3|53255/$D007|
|4| 53256/$D008| 4|53257/$D009|
|5| 53258/$D00A| 5|53259/$D00B|
|6| 53260/$D00C| 6|53261/$D00D|
|7| 53262/$D00E| 7|53263/$D00F|

The values in these registers specify a sprite's position on
the screen. Actually, the values set the position of the upper
left corner of the 24 X 21-pixel sprite pattern. The coordinate
system used is slightly different from the one used for bitmapped
graphics, as illustrated in next figure. Note that the
sprite coordinate system remains the same regardless of the
current screen mode (character or bitmapped) or sprite mode
(standard or multicolor).

![Vic sprite position values](./resources/008-06-f-vic-sprite-position-values.png "Vic sprite position values")

The horizontal position range includes both the active
screen area and the inactive left and right borders, in units
that equal standard screen pixel widths. The vertical position
range also includes the top and bottom borders in addition to
the active screen area. Note that the horizontal position can be
greater than 255, which is the largest value that can be stored
in a horizontal position register. To move a sprite to horizontal
position 256, you must set the horizontal position register to
0/$00 and set the most significant horizontal bit for that sprite
(in the register at 53264/$D010) to %1.

The most significant
bit must remain set for all positions greater than 255. Because
of the extra programming required to move the sprite to this
right portion of the screen, the vertical column at horizontal
position 256 is frequently referred to as the seam.
The values in these registers cannot be changed directly
while the normal BASIC IRQ routine [$A84D] is in use. That
routine copies the contents of the shadow sprite position locations
([4566-4582/$11D6-$11E6](11D6#11D6)) into these registers during
each system IRQ interrupt. There are two
ways to deal with this. The simplest solution is to store the
desired sprite position values in the proper shadow location.

If you wish to use the true registers, you can prevent the execution of
the BASIC portion of the IRQ interrupt. This will disable most
BASIC sprite and sound commands, but that shouldn't be a
problem for machine language programmers. To prevent execution of
the BASIC IRQ routine, you can either set bit 0 of
the initialization status flag at [2564/$0A04](#0A04) to %0 (which tells
the Kernal that BASIC is not initialized), or you can store any
nonzero value in the BASIC IRQ status flag at [4861/$12FD](#12FD).

## 53265 $D011 Vertical smooth scrolling and control register <a name="D011"></a>
**Bits 0-2**: these bits control the VIC's vertical fine scrolling
feature. The value here specifies how many scan lines downward
the display should be shifted. The available three bits
allow the screen to be scrolled up to seven scan lines. The
IOINIT routine [$E109] initializes these bits to %011 = 3, so
the default display will be scrolled down three scan lines from
its highest possible position.
The display scrolls without wrapping; blank scan lines are
moved in from the top and scan lines on the bottom move off
the visible screen. Pixels in scan lines scrolled off the bottom
of the display are not erased. They become visible again if the
display is scrolled back upward by reducing the value in these
bits. The 24-row feature is useful with scrolling because it
creates hidden scan lines at the top and bottom of the screen that
can be scrolled onto the visible area.

**Bit 3**: this bit determines the vertical height of the active
portion of the screen display. Setting this bit to %1 selects a 25-row
(200 scan-line) active screen. The bit is initialized to this
setting during the IOINIT routine [$E109], and neither the
operating system nor BASIC changes this value. Setting this bit
to %0 reduces the height of the active portion of the display
to 24 rows (192 scan lines) by blanking the top four and bottom
four scan lines of the display. The pixels in the blanked
columns aren't erased; they'll still be intact when the screen is
switched back to 25 rows. The 24-row feature is useful in
conjunction with the vertical scrolling feature described in bits 0-2.

**Bit 4**: this bit enables or disables the VIC screen display.
While the bit is %1, the VIC provides its normal screen output.
The bit is initialized to this setting during the IOINIT routine [$E109].
When the bit is set to %0, the VIC suspends the
active portion of the display and provides a solid screen in the
border color specified in the register at [53280/$D020](#D020). The
screen is not erased, just blanked. Any text or graphics will
still be intact if the screen is again enabled. With the display
blanked, the VIC doesn't have to steal timing cycles from the
processor as it normally does. As a result, the 128 actually
runs about 7 percent faster with the VIC display off.
There are several uses for this blanking feature. For example, you
could blank the display while drawing a complex
bitmapped graphics screen, then dramatically unveil the completed
picture by reenabling the display. Since the VIC cannot
provide a proper display at the 2-MHz clock rate, the VIC display
is normally blanked when the system is switched to fast
mode. One step in the BASIC statement FAST involves setting
this bit to %0. The SLOW statement returns it to %1. This bit
is also set to %0 to blank the screen during tape operations,
and restored to %1 upon completion of the operations.

**Bit 5**: this bit selects whether the VIC will generate a character
mode display or a bitmapped mode display.
Setting this bit to %0 selects character mode, while setting it
to %1 selects bitmapped mode.
This bit cannot be directly modified while the normal system interrupt
sequence is active because a step in the screen editor IRQ routine
[$C194] sets this bit according to the screen
mode flag (location [216/$D8](0000#D8)). To change the setting of this
bit, you can either store the appropriate value in the flag
location, or you can disable the screen-setup portion of the IRQ
routine and change this bit directly. To use the flag location,
set bit 5 of location [216/$D8](0000#D8) to the desired setting (%0 or %1)
for the register bit. To turn off the screen-setup portion of the
interrupt routine, store the value 255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8).

**Bit 6**: this bit controls extended background color mode,
which offers a choice of four different background colors for
each character position. For details about this mode, refer to
the introduction for this section. Extended background color
mode is enabled when this bit is set to %1. The mode works
only in conjunction with character mode. You should not select
extended background color mode while bit 5 is set to %1
to select bitmapped mode.

**Bit 7**: this bit is effectively the ninth bit of the raster register
at 53266/$D011. Refer to the discussion of that register for
details. The extra bit is necessary because a full screen contains
more than 256 scan lines.

## 53266 $D012 Raster compare register <a name="D012"></a>
This register has two different functions, depending on
whether it is being read from or written to. As explained in
the introduction for this section, the video screen display
consists of a stack of thin horizontal lines of dots called a raster.
When the register is read, the value returned is the number of
the raster scan line currently being drawn. The range of scanline
numbers depends on the video system in use. For NTSC
(North American) systems, values can be in the range 0-262,
while PAL (European) systems have a maximum count of over
300.

In either case, the active portion of the screen consists of
scan lines 50-249.
The maximum scan-line number in either system is larger
than can be held in a single eight-bit register, so bit 7 of the
register at [53265/$D011](#D011) is used to hold the ninth bit of the
value. When bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011) is %1, you should add
256/$100 to the value in this register to get the true scan-line
number. For scan line 262, for example, bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011)
will be %1 and the value in this register will be 6/$06.

Because
the value in this register changes so rapidly (over 15,000
times per second), it can't be read usefully from BASIC. By the
time you PEEKed the value into a variable, the raster scan line
would have moved far beyond the line recorded in the variable value.
When you write to this register or to bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011),
the value written is stored in an internal nine-bit raster
compare latch register. Whenever the current scan-line count
equals the value in this register, bit 0 of the interrupt register
at [53273/$D019](D019) will be set to %1. If bit 0 of the interrupt
mask register at [53274/$D01A](D01A) was previously set to %1, this
will also trigger an external interrupt request to the processor.
The value you store in this register represents the scan line at
which you wish the interrupt to occur.

For scan-line values
less than 256, you must also set bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011) to %0.
For scan-line values of 256 or greater, you must set bit 7 of
[53265/$D011](#D011) to %1 and store the line number minus 256 in
this register. To calculate the top scan line corresponding to
any row of character positions, use the following formula:

```
scan line = (row * 8) + 50
```

where the row value is in the range 0-24.

Raster interrupts can be used to program a variety of special
video effects, including split screens like those in the
GRAPHIC 2 and GRAPHIC 4 modes. The 128 also uses a raster interrupt
off the visible screen (at scan line 255) to drive
the system IRQ sequence. Because of this, you cannot write a
new value directly to this register while the the normal system
interrupt sequence is in use. The screen-setup portion of the
screen editor IRQ routine [$C194] will write the value 255/$FF
to this register on every pass, except when setting up the bitmapped
portion of a split bitmapped/text screen. In that case,
the value in location [2612/$0A34](0A34) will be copied into the register.

In either case, bit 7 of the register at [53265/$D011](#D011) will
be set to %0. To use a raster interrupt for your own purposes,
you must write a new interrupt routine.

### <a name="D013"></a><a name="D014"></a> 53267/$D013 53268/$D014 Light pen horizontal and vertical positions
Whenever the VIC's LP input line is brought to a low (0 volts)
state, the raster beam's horizontal dot position and vertical
scan line are latched into these registers. The register at
53267/$D013 will hold the horizontal position value, and the
one at 53268/$D014 will hold the vertical position value. To
signal that a new value has been latched, bits 7 and 3 of the
interrupt register at [53273/$D019](#D019) will be set to %1. These
registers are read-only; writing to them has no effect. The
registers are not cleared when read; the latched values will be
retained until the LP line is again brought low.
The range of scan-line values in the register at 53268/$D014
is the same as the range of sprite vertical positions
shown in previous one figure. For example, the top scan line of the active
screen area is 50. In that figure, you'll note that the range
of horizontal positions extends to 343, which is greater than
can be represented in a single eight-bit register. To compensate,
the range of horizontal values in the register at 53267/$D013
is the equivalent of one-half the range of horizontal
values shown in previous one figure. For example, the horizontal-position
value for the center of the screen is 184, so the corresponding
light pen position will be about 92.

The LP line is connected to pin 6 of control port 1 (control port 2
does not support a light pen). A light pen has at its
tip an electronic device known as a phototransistor, which is
connected so as to cause a low pulse whenever the video
beam moves past the pen. These registers can be tricked into
reading false values. Pin 6 of control port 1 is also used for
light pen input for the VIC chip, so a light pen signal generated
on the 80-column screen will latch meaningless values in
these registers. In lieu of a light pen, several other events can
cause a pulse on the LP line. That control port pin is also used
for the joystick fire button, so pressing the button of a joystick
plugged into port 1 will also latch values in these registers.
Because of this joystick button function, the port line is also
connected to the line from row 4 of the keyboard matrix. This has
two consequences. First, pressing any of the following keys
with no light pen connected will latch meaningless values: Fl,
Z, C, B, M, period, right SHIFT, space, the 2 and ENTER keys
on the numeric keypad, and the ^ key in the cursor group.
More significantly, while a light pen is connected, all of these
keys will be "dead," and cannot be typed.

## 53269 $D015 Sprite enable register <a name="D015"></a>
This register controls which sprites are enabled. Only enabled
sprites can be visible, and only enabled sprites can be involved
in collisions. Setting a bit in this register to %1 enables
the corresponding sprite. However, an enabled sprite won't be
visible unless it is also positioned within the visible screen
area, has a pattern definition that includes some nonzero bits,
and is set to a color different from the screen background
color. Setting a bit in this register to %0 turns off the
corresponding sprite, but does not change the setting of any other
parameters. When reenabled, the sprite will still have the
same position, color, and pattern (unless those were changed
while the sprite was turned off). The sprites are controlled as
follows:

|Bit|Bit value|Sprite controlled|
|-|-|-|
|0|1/$01  | 0|
|1|2/$02  | 1|
|2|4/$04  | 2|
|3|8/$08  | 3|
|4|16/$10 | 4|
|5|32/$20 | 5|
|6|64/$40 | 6|
|7|128/$80| 7|

This register is initialized to 0/$00 (all sprites disabled) by
the IOINIT routine [$E109], part of the reset and RUN/
STOP-RESTORE sequences. Sprites are normally disabled
during tape and serial bus operations to prevent timing problems.
In this case, the contents of the register are stored in location
[2616/$0A38](0A38) for the duration of the operation, then
restored to the register when the operation is completed. You
can prevent this and keep sprites enabled by setting bit 7 of
the custom mode flag ([2618/$0A3A](0A3A)) to %1.

## 53270 $D016 Horizontal smooth scrolling and control register <a name="D016"></a>
**Bits 0-2**: these bits control the VIC's horizontal smooth scrolling
feature. The value here specifies the number of pixels the
display is to be shifted to the right. The available three bits
allow the screen to be shifted as many as seven pixels. The
display scrolls without wrapping; blank pixels are moved in
from the left and pixels on the right move off the visible
screen. Pixels scrolled off the right are not erased, just hidden.
They will become visible again if the display is scrolled back
to the left by reducing the value in these bits. The 38-column
feature is useful with scrolling because it creates a hidden left
column that can hold pixels to be scrolled onto the visible area.

**Bit 3**: this bit determines the horizontal width of the screen.
Setting this bit to %1 selects a 40-column (320-pixel) screen.
The bit is initialized to this setting during the IOINIT routine
[$E109], and neither the operating system nor BASIC ever
change this value. Changing this bit to %0 reduces the width
of the active portion of the display to 38 columns (304 pixels)
by blanking the leftmost and rightmost columns. Actually, 7
pixels on the left and 9 on the right are blanked. The contents
of the blanked columns aren't erased; they'll still be intact
when the screen is switched back to 40 columns. The 38-column
feature is useful in conjunction with the horizontal scrolling
feature in bits 0-2. Scrolling the 38-column screen the maximum 7
pixels to the right will make the contents of the previously hidden
leftmost column visible.

**Bit 4**: this bit controls multicolor mode for both the character
and bitmapped screens. While this bit is %0, foreground pixels
will be limited to one color (although the color can be different
for every character position). Setting this bit to %1 enables
multicolor mode, which allows a choice of three different colors
for each foreground pixel. However, selecting multicolor
mode also cuts horizontal resolution for the screen in half.
Selecting multicolor mode for the screen has no effect on any
sprites that might be displayed on that screen.

Sprite multicolor
mode is controlled by the register at [53276/$D01C](#D01C).
This bit cannot be directly modified while the normal system
interrupt sequence is active because a step in the screen
editor IRQ routine [$C194] sets this bit according to the screen
mode flag (location [216/$D8](0000#D8)). To change the setting of this bit
for bitmapped mode, you can either store the appropriate
value in the flag location, or you can disable the screen-setup
portion of the IRQ routine and change this bit directly. To use
the flag location, set bit 7 of location [216/$D8](0000#D8) to the desired
setting (%0 or %1) for the register bit. To turn off the screensetup
portion of the interrupt routine, store the value 255/$FF
in location [216/$D8](0000#D8).

To select multicolor character mode, you
must use the option to disable the screen setup, since the text
mode-setup subroutine always sets this bit to %0.

**Bit 5**: this bit is referred to in Commodore literature as
the reset bit, but its intended usage is unclear. The value here has
no apparent affect on any VIC operations.

**Bits 6-7**: these bits are unused. Writing to them has no effect,
and they always return %1 when read.

## 53271 $D017 Sprite vertical expansion register <a name="D017"></a>
Each bit in this register controls the vertical expansion feature
for one of the eight sprites. The relationship of sprites to register
bits is the same as for the sprite enable register ([53269/$D015](#D015)).
Setting a bit here to %1 will double the vertical
height of the corresponding sprite. Each sprite can be expanded
independently, with regard for the background screen
on which the sprite is displayed. The resolution of the sprite is
not increased-it will still be 21 pixels tall-but the height of
the pixels will be doubled. Vertical expansion can be selected
in conjunction with horizontal expansion to double the size of
a sprite. Horizontal expansion is controlled by the register at
[53277/$D01D](#D01D). The default value in this register, established
by the IOINIT routine [$E109], is 0/$00, so no sprites are initially
expanded.

## 53272 $D018 Screen and character base address register <a name="D018"></a>
The value in this register determines the location within the
current 16K VIC video bank of the two movable components
of video memory: the screen memory/video matrix and character
memory/bitmap areas. There is no provision for moving
color memory; that area always appears at 55296-56319/$D800-$DBFF.

The contents of this register cannot be changed
directly while the normal system IRQ interrupt sequence is in
use. The screen editor IRQ routine [$C194] copies the contents
of a shadow location into this register during each interrupt.
The shadow location depends on the screen mode in use. For
text mode, or for the text portion of a split screen, the contents
of location 2604/$0A2C will be copied here. For bitmapped
modes, the value in location 2605/$0A2D will be copied into
the register. You have two choices for changing the value in
this register. You can either store the desired value in the
appropriate shadow location, or you can turn off the screen
setup portion of the screen editor IRQ routine to gain direct
access to the register. To disable the screen-setup step, store
the value 255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8).

**Bit 0**: this bit is unused. Writing to it has no effect, and it
always returns %1 when read. Thus, the value read from this
register will always be odd.

**Bits 1-3**: the value in these bits determines the location of
character memory (for character mode) or of the bitmap (for bitmapped
modes). For character mode, a complete 256-character
set requires 2048 (2K) bytes, and the character set must start
on an even 2K memory address boundary. Possible selections
are as follows:

|Bits 3-2-1|Offset for character set|
|-|-|
|0 0 0|0/$00|
|0 0 1|2048/$0800|
|0 1 0|4096/$1000|
|0 1 1|6144/$1800|
|1 0 0|8192/$2000|
|1 0 1|10240/$2800|
|1 1 0|12288/$3000|
|1 1 1|14336/$3800|

These bits do not determine the absolute address of the character set,
but rather the offset from the starting address of the
current video bank. For example, video bank 2 begins at address
32768/$8000, so a bit setting of %100 in that case
would place the character set at 32768 + 8192 = 40960/$A000.
However, the default video bank (bank 0) begins at location
0/$0000, so in that case the offset is equal to the actual address.
The 128 normally provides a pair of character sets and allows you
to switch between them by pressing the SHIFT -
Commodore key combination. If you are setting up a single
custom character set, you should disable this character
set-switching feature by setting bit 7 of location [247/$F7](0000#F7) to
%1. If you wish to retain the character set-switching feature,
you must provide two character sets, one at an "even" position
(one for which bit 1 of this register is %0), and the other
at the next higher ("odd") position.
The CINT screen editor initialization routine [$C07B] sets
bits 1-3 to %010 in location 2604/$0A2C, the shadow for this
register in text mode. This places the default character memory
at an offset of 4096/$1000 from the starting address of the
video bank (and implies that the alternate character set will be
located at an offset of 6144/$1800), This may seem strange,
since there is certainly no character pattern data stored in
RAM at addresses 4096-8191/$1000-$1FFF/ and since the
128's memory map shows that the character ROM is actually
located at addresses 53248-57343/$D000-$DFFF.

However,
the 128 has the capability to make the VIC chip see character
ROM at addresses 4096-6143/$1000-$17FF (for the uppercase/
graphics set) and addresses 6144-8191/$1800-$1FFF (for the
lowercase/uppercase set) in any video bank. Note that this is
a change from the Commodore 64, which could only see character
ROM in video banks 0 and 2.

Only the VIC will see the character ROM at those addresses.
To the processor, those locations will still be RAM.
This feature is controlled by bit 2 of the 8502's built-in
I/O port, at location [1/$01](0000#01). When bit 2 of the register at
[1/$01](0000#01) is %0, the VIC chip will see character ROM in the character
memory areas beginning at addresses 4096/$1000 and
6144/$1800. No other character memory slots are affected.

When the I/O port bit is set to %1, the VIC will instead see
the true contents of RAM at those addresses rather than images
of the character ROM. Like other screen control locations,
the I/O port bit has a shadow location. Bit 2 of location
[217/$D9](0000#D9) is copied into bit 2 of location [1/$01](0000#01) during each
pass through the text screen-setup portion of the screen editor
IRQ routine. To switch out character ROM, you must set bit 2
of the shadow location to %1 (store the value 4/$04 in location [217/$D9](0000#D9)). 
Alternatively, you can disable the screen-setup
portion of the screen editor IRQ routine by storing the value
255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8); then you change bit 2 of location [1/$01](0000#01) directly.
Finding free space for a custom character set can be a challenge.
If you are using machine language exclusively, any of
the character set slots above address 4864/$1300 can be used,
but none of the address slots are completely free in the standard
configuration with BASIC. If you disable character ROM,
there is free memory at 6144-7167/$1800-$1BFF for half a character
set (128 character patterns). If your program doesn't use
a bitmapped screen, you can allocate a bitmap area and then
use the reserved space for custom character sets. For example,
if your BASIC program includes the statements GRAPHIC
1:GRAPHIC 0, the area from 7168-16383/$1C00-$3FFF will
be protected from BASIC, and any character memory slot in
that area can be used to hold the new character set.
Since the bitmap for a high-resolution display requires
8000 bytes of memory and must begin at an even 8K memory
address boundary, there are only two possible positions for
the bitmap within the 16K video bank. When you are specifying the
location of the bitmap, only the setting of bit 3 is significant.
When that bit is %0, the bitmap will begin at an
offset of 0/$0000 from the start of the video bank. When bit 3
is %1, the bitmap begins at an offset of 8192/$2000 from the
start of the video bank. The CINT screen editor initialization
routine [$C07B] sets bits 1-3 to %100 in location 2605/$0A2D,
the shadow for this register in bitmapped mode, so the default
location of the bitmap is 8192/$2000 bytes beyond the start of
the video bank (address 8192/$2000 for the default video bank).

**Bits 4-7**: these bits determine the location of the video matrix
area, which is used as screen memory in character mode and
to hold color information in bitmapped mode. The video matrix requires
1000 bytes of memory and must start on an even
IK address boundary. Possible selections are as follows:

| Bits 7-6-5-4 | Offset for video matrix |
|-|-|
|0 0 0 0 |0/$0000|
|0 0 0 1 |1024/$0400|
|0 0 1 0 |2048/$0800|
|0 0 1 1 |3072/$0C00|
|0 1 0 0 |4096/$1000|
|0 1 0 1 |5120/$1400|
|0 1 1 0 |6144/$1800|
|0 1 1 1 |7168/$1C00|
|1 0 0 0 |8192/$2000|
|1 0 0 1 |9216/$2400|
|1 0 1 0 |10240/$2800|
|1 0 1 1 |11264/$2C00|
|1 1 0 0 |12288/$3000|
|1 1 0 1 |13312/$3400|
|1 1 1 0 |14336/$3800|
|1 1 1 1 |15360/$3C00|

These bits do not determine the absolute address of the video
matrix, but rather the offset from the starting address of the
current video bank. For example, video bank 3 begins at address
49152/$C000, so a bit setting of %0010 in that case
would place the character set at 49152 + 2048 = 51200/$C800.

However, the default video bank (bank 0) begins at location 0/$0000,
so in that case the offset is equal to the actual address.

The CINT screen editor initialization routine [$C07B] sets
bits 4-7 to %0001 in location 2604/$0A2C, the shadow for
this register in text mode. This places the default character
memory at an offset of 1024/$0400 from the starting address
of the video bank. You can't change this register directly while
the normal system interrupt sequence is active. To move the
video matrix for the text screen, you can either change the
value in location 2604/$0A2C, or you can turn off the screensetup
portion of the interrupt sequence by storing the value
255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8). After that, you can change the
register directly. Even if you change the value in this register,
all printed characters will continue to go to the former screen
memory range until you change the value in location 2619/$0A3B
to reflect the new starting page for screen memory.

Because the bitmap for a high-resolution display requires
half of the memory available in a 16K video bank, only half of
the possible addresses are really useful. When setting up a
bitmapped display, you should select a video matrix area in the
portion of the video bank not occupied by the bitmap. The
CINT screen editor initialization routine [$C07B] sets bits 4-7
to %0111 in location 2605/$0A2D, the shadow for this register in
bitmapped mode, so the default location of the video
matrix in that mode is 7168/$1C00 bytes from the start of the
video bank (address 7168/$1C00 for the default video bank).
Thus, the bitmapped mode video matrix will not disturb character
mode screen memory.

To move the video matrix for the bitmapped screen, you
can either change the value in location 2605/$0A2D, or you
can turn off the screen-setup portion of the interrupt sequence
by storing the value 255/$FF in location [216/$D8](0000#D8). After that,
you can change the register directly.

### Interrupt register
This register is read-only; writing to this location has no effect.
Bits 0-3 indicate the status of the four interrupt sources for the
VIC chip. These bits will always reflect the status of their corresponding events, regardless of whether or not register
[53274/$D01A](#D01A) has been set to trigger an external interrupt request for the event. Once a bit here is set to %1, it will retain
that value until the register is read, at which time all functional bits are reset to %0.

**Bit 0**: This bit will be set to %1 whenever the raster scan-line
count equals the value in the raster compare register [53266/$D012](#D012) (plus bit 7 of [53265/$D011](#D011)).

**Bit 1**: This bit will be set to %1 whenever a nontransparent
portion of a sprite overlaps any screen foreground pixels. (Remember, however, that for multicolor character or multicolor
bitmapped screens, no collision can be detected between
sprites and foreground pixels represented by %01 bit patterns.)
The register at [53279/$D01F](#D01F) records which sprites are involved in collisions with foreground data.

**Bit 2**: This bit will be set to %1 whenever two or more sprites
overlap. Collisions can only be detected between the foreground portion of the sprites, those pixels represented by nonzero bit patterns. No collision is detected when the overlapping portions of the sprites are transparent (when the pixels
are represented by %0 or %00 bit patterns). The register at location [53278/$D01E](#D01E) records which sprites are involved in collisions with other sprites.

**Bit 3**: This bit will be set to %1 whenever a new value is
latched into the light pen registers at [53267-53268/$D013-$D014](#D013).

**Bits 4-6**: The bits are not used, and always return %1 when
read.

**Bit 7**: Whenever any internal interrupt source sets one of the
other bits in this register to %1 , this bit will also be set to %1
to indicate that an internal interrupt has been recorded. Thus,
you need to test only this bit to determine whether an internal
interrupt has occurred. Note that this register is automatically
cleared after it is read, so you'll need to save the register value
before testing this bit if you want to be able to subsequently
read any of the other bits.

## 53274 $D01A IRQMSK <a name="D01A"></a>
### Interrupt enable register

Certain events such as sprite-sprite collisions always generate
internal VIC interrupts, recorded in the register at [53273/$D019](#D010). The VIC chip has the capability to generate an external interrupt request to the processor as a result of any of
these conditions. In the 128, the VIC's interrupt request output
line is connected to the processor's IRQ line, so internal VIC
events can trigger processor IRQ interrupts. See Appendix A
for more information on IRQ interrupts.

**Bit 0**: Setting this bit to %1 enables an external interrupt request when the raster count match is recorded in the flag at
bit 0 of the register at [53273/$D019](#D019). Because raster interrupts
are the normal source of the system jiffy interrupt that drives
keyboard scanning and other important housekeeping features, this bit is initialized to %1 by the Kernal IOINIT routine
[$E109]. Changing this bit to %0 will completely disable the
system interrupt.

**Bit 1**: Setting this bit to %1 enables an external interrupt request when a sprite-foreground collision is recorded in the flag
at bit 1 of the register at [53273/$D019](#D019), as when a sprite
passes over a character on the text screen.

**Bit 2**: Setting this bit to %1 enables an external interrupt request when a sprite-sprite collision is recorded in the flag at
bit 2 of the register at [53273/$D019](#D019).

**Bit 3**: Setting this bit to %1 enables an external interrupt request when a new value is recorded in the flag at bit 3 of the
register at [53273/$D019](#D019). It is risky to use this interrupt
source, because a number of events other than the light pen
can trigger the latching of values into these registers. See the
entry for the light pen registers for details.

**Bits 4-7**: These bits are unused; writing to them has no effect,
and they always return %1 when read. Thus, the value seen
when this register is read will always be at least 240/$F0. To
mask off these unused bits and see the valid interrupt settings,
use AND 15 in BASIC or AND #$0F in machine language.

## 53275 $D01B SPBGPR <a name="D01B"></a>
### Sprite-to-foreground priority register

Each bit in this register controls the sprite-to-foreground priority for one of the eight sprites. The relationship of sprites to
bits is the same as for the sprite enable register ([53269/$D015](#D015)). While a bit here is %0, the corresponding sprite will
have higher priority than the screen foreground, and will thus
appear to pass in front of anything displayed in the foreground color on the text or bitmapped screens. When a bit
here is set to %1 , the corresponding sprite will have lower priority than the screen foreground, and will thus appear to pass
behind anything displayed in the foreground color. For multicolor character or multicolor bitmapped screen modes, the
low-priority sprite will appear to pass behind screen pixels
represented by %10 and %11 bit patterns, but will still pass in
front of pixels represented by %01 bit patterns. (The sprite always appears in front of pixels with the %00 background bit
pattern.) The default value for this register, established by the
IOINIT routine [$E109], is 0/$00, so all sprites initially have
higher priority than the screen foreground.

## 53276 $D01C SPMC <a name="D01C"></a>
### Sprite multicolor mode register

Each bit in this register controls the multicolor feature for one
of the eight sprites. The relationship of sprites to register bits
is the same as for the sprite enable register ([53269/$D015](#D015)).
Setting a bit here to %1 selects multicolor mode for the corresponding sprite. Multicolor mode can be selected independently for each sprite, and standard and multicolor sprites can
be mixed freely on the same screen. Multicolor sprites are not
restricted to multicolor screen modes; they can be used freely
in standard screen modes as well. The default value for this
register, established during the IOINIT routine [$E109], is
0/$00, so no sprites are initially in multicolor mode.

Selecting multicolor mode for a sprite reduces the number
of horizontal pixels for the sprite from 24 to 12. However, the
sprite remains the same size; the multicolor sprite pixels are
twice as wide. Two bits of the pattern definition are required
for each pixel. All pixels represented by %00 are transparent;
whatever is behind the sprite will show through. Pixels with
%01 and %11 bit patterns take their color values from the registers at [53285/$D025](#D025) and [53286/$D026](#D026), respectively, which
are common to all multicolor sprites. Pixels with %10 bit patterns take the color specified in the color register for the particular sprite ([53287-53294/$D027-$D02E](#D027)).

## 53277 $D01D XXPAND <a name="D01D"></a>
### Sprite horizontal expansion register

Each bit in this register controls the horizontal expansion feature for one of the eight sprites. The relationship of sprites to register bits is the same as for the sprite enable register
([53269/$D015](#D015)). Setting a bit here to %1 will double the horizontal width of the corresponding sprite. Each sprite can be
expanded independently, without regard for the background
screen on which the sprite is displayed. The resolution of the
sprite is not increased (it will still be 24 pixels wide) but the
width of the pixels will be doubled. Horizontal expansion can
be selected in conjunction with vertical expansion to double
the size of a sprite. (Vertical expansion is controlled by the
register at [53271/$D017](#D017).) The default value in this register,
established by the IOINIT routine [$E109], is 0/$00, so no
sprites are initially expanded.

## 53278 $D01E SPSPCL <a name="D01E"></a>
### Sprite-to-sprite collision register

This register records collisions between two or more sprites.
This register is read-only; storing values here has no effect. A
collision occurs whenever any nontransparent portions of the
sprites overlap. Transparent pixels (pixels with bit patterns of
%0 or %00) are not involved in collisions. When sprites collide, the bits in this register corresponding to those sprites are
set to %1 (the correspondence between sprites and bits is the
same as for the sprite enable register). Since a minimum of
two sprites are involved in any sprite-sprite collision, at least
two bits will be set. The register is automatically cleared to
0/$00 after each time it is read, so you'll need to store the
value you read if you wish to perform multiple tests. Bit 2 of
the interrupt register at [53273/$D019](#D019) will also be set to %1 whenever any sprite-sprite collision occurs.

This register indicates only that sprites have collided. It
does not necessarily tell you which sprites are involved in a
particular collision. If only two bits are set, then those sprites
obviously must have hit each other. However, if you find that
three or more bits are set, you must read the horizontal and
vertical position registers for the involved sprites and determine which sprites are in contact with each other. Remember
that the sprite position registers return the position of the upper left corner of the sprite, which may not be the point of the
sprite that is colliding with the foreground.

One thing to beware of when reading this register is that
after a sprite overlaps a foreground object, the register will
continue to record collisions until the sprite is moved away from the object. Also, sprite-sprite collisions can occur even
when the sprites are located completely outside the visible
screen area.

## 53279 $D01F SPFGCL <a name="D01F"></a>
### Sprite-foreground collision register

This register records collisions between sprites and the screen
foreground. This register is read-only; storing values here has
no effect. A collision occurs whenever any pixel in a sprite
represented by a nonzero bit pattern overlaps any foreground
pixel on the screen, as when a sprite passes over a character
on the text screen. Background or transparent pixels are not
involved in collisions. For the purposes of collision detection,
multicolor screen pixels represented by %01 bit patterns are
not considered foreground, and no collision will be detected
when a sprite pixel overlaps a multicolor screen %01 pixel.
When a sprite collides with a foreground pixel, the bit in this
register corresponding to that sprite is set to %1 (the correspondence between sprites and bits is the same as for the
sprite enable register). The register is automatically cleared to
0/$00 after each time it is read, so you'll need to store the
value you read if you wish to perform multiple tests. Bit 1 of
the interrupt register at [53273/$D019](#D019) will also be set to %1
whenever any sprite-foreground collision occurs.

This register indicates only that a sprite has collided with
some portion of the screen foreground. It does not tell you exactly what the sprite is overlapping. To determine that, you
must determine which sprite or sprites are involved in collisions, then read the horizontal and vertical position registers
for the involved sprites and determine what screen-foreground
object is located in that vicinity. Remember that the sprite position registers return the position of the upper left corner of
the sprite, which may not be the point of the sprite that is colliding with the foreground.

One thing to beware of when reading this register is that
after a sprite overlaps a foreground object, the register will
continue to record collisions until the sprite is moved away
from the object.

## 53280 $D020 EXTCOL <a name="D020"></a>
### Border color register

The value in this register determines the color of the screen
border, the area of the screen surrounding the active portion
of the display. When the screen is blanked by setting bit 4 of
the register at [53265/$D011](#D011) to %0, the entire display area will
be filled with the color specified here. Since the VIC can produce only 16 different colors, only four bits are required to
hold all possible color values. Thus, only bits 0-3 of this location hold meaningful values. Bits 4-7 are unused; writing to
those bits has no effect, and the bits always return % 1 when
read. Thus, the value in this register will always be at least
240/$F0. To mask off these bits and read the true color value
you should use AND 15 in BASIC or AND #$0F in machine
language. See Table 8-1 for a list of standard VIC color values.
The default setting for this register, established by the IOINIT
routine [$E109], is 13/$0D (light green). From BASIC, the
value here can be changed using the statement COLOR 4,rc
(where n is the desired BASIC color number; BASIC color
numbers are equal to VIC color values plus one).

## 53281 $D021 BGCOL0 <a name="D021"></a>
### Background color register 0

In standard character mode, the value here determines the
color of all pixels in a screen position which are represented
by %0 bits in the character pattern. This background color is
common to all screen positions. Clearing the screen fills all positions with the screen code for the space character, which has
a pattern that is all %0 bits. Thus, a cleared screen will be filled
with the color specified here. The color of pixels with %1 bits in
the character pattern (the foreground color) is determined by
the value in the color memory location for the position.

This register is also used in both of the other character
modes. In multicolor character mode, the value here determines the color of all pixels in all screen positions represented
by %00 bit pairs in the character pattern. In extended background color mode, the value here determines the background
color in any screen positions for which bits 6-7 of the screen
code in the corresponding screen memory location are %00.
This register is unused in standard bitmapped mode, but for
multicolor bitmapped mode the value here determines the
color for all pixels represented in the bitmap by %00 bit pairs.

Since the VIC can produce only 16 different colors, only
four bits are required to hold all possible color values. Thus,
only bits 0-3 of this location hold meaningful values. Bits 4-7
are unused; writing to those bits has no effect, and the bits always return %1 when read. Thus, the value in this register
will always be at least 240/$F0. To mask off these bits and
read the true color value you should use AND 15 in BASIC or
AND #$0F in machine language. See Table 8-1 for a list of
standard VIC color values. This register is initialized to
11/$0B (dark gray) by the IOINIT routine [$E109], part of
both the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences. From
BASIC, the value here can be changed using the statement
COLOR 0,n (where n is the desired BASIC color number;
BASIC color numbers are equal to VIC color values plus one.)

## 53284 $D024 BGCOL3 <a name="D024"></a>
### Background color registers 1-3

These three registers are used only when multicolor character
mode or extended background color mode is enabled. For
multicolor character mode, the value in 53282/$D022 determines the color of any pixels in a screen position represented
by %01 bit pairs in the character pattern, and the value in
53283/$D023 determines the color of all pixels with %10
pairs. Since there is only one set of registers for all screen positions, the colors of pixels with %01 and %10 bit pairs will be
common to all characters on the screen. The color of pixels
with %00 bit pairs is determined by the value in
[53281/$D021](#D021), and the color of pixels with %11 bit pairs is selected individually for each character position by the value in
the corresponding color memory location (55296-56319/$D800-$DBFF). The register at 53284/$D024 is unused in multicolor character mode.

For extended background color mode, these registers determine the background color for the character position for the
character, depending on the setting of bits 6-7 of the screen
code in the screen memory location for the position. The selections are as follows:

|Bits 7-6|Background color source register|
|-|-|
|0 0|53281/$D021|
|0 1|53282/$D022|
|1 0|53283/$D023|
|1 1|53284/$D024|

Since the VIC can produce only 16 different colors, only
four bits are required to hold all possible color values. Thus,
only bits 0-3 of these locations hold meaningful values. Bits
4-7 in any of these locations are unused. Writing to those bits
has no effect, and the bits always return %1 when read. Thus,
the value in any of these locations will always be at least
240/$F0. To mask off these bits and read the true color value
you should use AND 15 in BASIC or AND #$0F in machine
language.
These registers are initialized during the IOINIT routine
[$E019], part of the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences. The default values are 1 (white) for 53282/$D022, 2
(red) for 53283/$D023, and 3 (cyan) for 53284/$D024. There
is no BASIC statement specifically for changing the settings of
these registers.

## 53286 $D026 SPMC1 <a name="D026"></a>
### Sprite multicolor registers

The values in these registers determine two of the colors for
multicolor sprites. A sprite can be switched to multicolor
mode by setting the appropriate bit in the register at [53276/$D01C](#D01C). The value in the register at 53285/$D025 determines
the color for all pixels in the sprite represented by %01 bit
pairs in the pattern. The value in 53286/$D026 determines the
color for all pixels represented by %11 bit pairs. Since there
are only these two registers for all eight sprites, the colors of
pixels with %01 and %11 bit pairs will be common to all
sprites. The color of pixels represented by %10 bit pairs can be
selected individually for each sprite using the registers at
[53287-53294/$D027-$D02E](#D027). Pixels with %00 bit pairs in the
pattern will be transparent.

Since the VIC can produce only 16 different colors, only
four bits are required to hold all possible color values. Thus,
only bits 0-3 of these locations hold meaningful values. Bits
4-7 in any of these locations are unused. Writing to those bits
has no effect, and the bits always return %1 when read. Thus,
the value in any of these locations will always be at least
240/$F0. To mask off these bits and read the true color value
you should use AND 15 in BASIC or AND #$0F in machine
language. See Table 8-1 for a list of standard VIC color values.
The default settings of these registers, established by the
IOINIT routine [$E109], are 1 (white) for 53285/$D025 and 2
(red) for 53286/$D026. From BASIC, these settings can be
changed using the SPRCOLOR statement.

### Sprite color registers
Each of these registers holds color information for one of the
eight sprites. For standard sprites, the value here determines
the color of all %1 bits in the sprite pattern (%0 bit positions
will be transparent). For multicolor sprites, the value here determines the color of all %10 bit groups in the pattern.

Since the VIC can produce only 16 different colors, only
four bits are required to hold all possible color values. Thus,
only bits 0-3 of these locations hold meaningful values. Bits
4-7 in any of these locations are unused. Writing to those bits
has no effect, and the bits always return %1 when read. Thus,
the value in any of these locations will always be at least
240/$F0. To mask off these bits and read the true color value
you should use AND 15 in BASIC or AND #$0F in machine
language. See Table 8-1 for a list of standard VIC color values.
The following table shows the default colors for each sprite,
established by the IOINIT routine [$E109], part of both the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences.

|Register|Sprite|Default color|
|-|-|-|
|53287/$D027|0|0 (black)|
|53288/$D028|1|1 (white)|

## 53295 $D02F XSCAN <a name="D02F"></a>
### Extended keyboard scan-line control register

**Bits 0-2**: Each of these bits controls the state of one of the
three output lines from the VIC chip, K0-K2. Setting a register
bit to %0 causes the corresponding output line to go to a low
(0 volts) state, while setting a register bit to %1 causes the
output line to go to a high (+ 5 volts) state. Reading these bits
returns the current state of the corresponding output lines. In
the 128, the three output lines are used to scan the three keyboard columns containing the 24 keys in the numeric keypad
and top row of control keys. See Figure 7-1 and the discussion
of the keyboard scanning routine [$C55D] in Chapter 7 for
more information.

Unless you are writing a custom keyboard scanning routine, there's rarely a need to tinker with this register. The output lines are connected only to the keyboard, and are not
available externally.

**Bits 3-7**: These bits are unused. Writing to them has no effect,
and they always return %1 when read. Thus, the value in this
location will always be at least 248/$F8. To mask off these irrelevant bits, use AND 7 in BASIC or AND #$07 in machine
language.

## 53296 $D030 CLKRATE <a name="D030"></a>
### Processor clock rate control register

**Bit 0**: This bit controls the processor clock speed. (Remember,
the VIC chip is the source of most of the system's timing signals.) When the bit is set to %0, the processor operates at its
normal 1-MHz rate. To be precise, the clock frequency is
1.02273 MHz for NTSC (North American) systems and 0.98525
MHz for PAL (European) systems. Setting this bit to %1 doubles the clock rate, providing what is commonly referred to as
2-megahertz (MHz) mode. This is also known as fast mode,
the old standard speed being disparagingly referred to as slow
mode. During the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences,
the IOINIT routine [$E109] sets this bit to %0 for slow mode.

Fast mode does have a few limitations. While the 8502
microprocessor and the VDC 80-column video chip have no
problems operating at the higher clock rate, most of the other
I/O chips cannot keep up at this speed. The VIC chip itself
cannot maintain its video display at this speed-the 40-column
screen becomes a colorful pattern of rapidly flashing squares.
It is common practice to set bit 4 of the VIC register at [53265/$D011](#D011) to %0 to blank the 40-column screen display while operating in 2-MHz mode. For example, the BASIC routine for
the FAST statement [$77B3] includes this step. The VDC provides an alternative to the VIC for fast mode, but other I/O
chips have no substitutes. In these cases, the system employs
an elaborate technique known as clock stretching, where the
clock period is extended to create an effective 1-MHz rate for
the portion of the clock cycle when the I/O chip is being
accessed.

Because some serial bus and tape communications
routines depend on software loops for timing functions, the
system is usually switched to the slower clock frequency when
serial bus or tape operations are being performed. The contents of this register are stored in location 2615/$0A37 during
the operation, and restored to the register when the operation
is completed. You can prevent this by setting bit 7 of the custom mode flag (location 2618/$0A3A) to %1. In this case, the
clock rate will not be changed during tape and serial
operations.

**Bit 1**: This bit is described in Commodore literature as a test
bit. The IOINIT routine [$E019] sets the bit to %0, and no
other 128 ROM routine changes that setting. Some programmers have discovered that setting this bit to %1 will blank the
40-column screen display, and have even used this as an alternative to clearing bit 4 of location [53265/$D011](#D011) when switching the processor to fast mode. While this does appear to work
without side effects, such undocumented "features" are best
avoided.

**Bits 2-7**: These bits are unused. Writing to them has no effect,
and they always return %1 when read. Thus, the value in this
register will always be at least 252/$FC. To mask off these
bits, use AND 3 in BASIC or AND #$03 in machine language.
