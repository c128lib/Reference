### I/O port data registers

These registers are used to read data from port lines which are
configured as inputs and to write data to port lines configured
as outputs. Refer to the entry for the CIA #1 ports at
56320-56321/$DC00-$DC01 for details of how these registers
and ports operate. For CIA #2, the ports are used as follows:

#### Port A (56576/$DD00)
Bits 0-1 of this port (lines FA0-PA1) are normally configured
as outputs and are used to specify which 16K area of the 64K
RAM block will be used for the current VIC video bank. The
four possible selections are as follows:

|Bits 1 0|Video bank|System address range|
|-|-|-|
|0 0|3|49152-65535/$C000-$FFFF|
|0 1|2|32768-49252/$8000-$BFFF|
|1 0|1|16384-32767/$4000-$7FFF|
|1 1|0|0-16383/$0000-$3FFF|

These bits are initialized to %11 by the IOINIT routine
[$E109](E000#E109) during the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences.
This selects video bank 0, the default bank, and the
128 itself never selects another bank. The 64K block from
which the video bank is seen is determined by bit 6 of the
MMU register at [$D506](D500#D506).

Bit 2 (port line PA2) is connected to pin M of the user
port. The line is normally configured as an output, and this bit
is initialized by the IOINIT routine to %1 , allowing the line to
go high (+5 volts). The Kernal RS-232 routines use this line
as the transmitted data (TXD) output. You can also use the
user port line for your own I/O functions.

The remaining bits are used for the serial bus, the 128's
avenue of communications with disk drives and printers. The
lines are connected as follows:

|Bit|Port line|Function|
|-|-|-|
|3|PA3|Handles output on the serial bus ATN line|
|4|PA4|Handles output on the serial bus CLK line|
|5|PA5|Handles output on the serial bus DATA line (for slow serial mode)|
|6|PA6|Handles input from the serial bus CLK line|
|7|PA7|Handles input from the serial bus DATA line (for slow serial mode)|

The bits for the output lines are all initialized to %0 by the
IOINIT routine, causing the output lines to be pulled low (0
volts). However, all these lines have inverters between the
CIA and the serial port connector, so pulling the port lines low
allows the lines at the serial port connector to go high. Refer
to the discussion of Kernal serial input and output routines in
Chapter 9 for more information on how these lines are used
for serial bus communications.

#### Port B (56577/$DD01)

All the lines from port B are tied directly to the user port, a
24-pin connector located on the back of the 128. The lines are
connected as follows:

|Bit|Port B line|User port pin|
|-|-|-|
|0|PB0|C|
|1|PB1|D|
|2|PB2|E|
|3|PB3|F|
|4|PB4|H|
|5|PB5|J|
|6|PB6|K|
|7|PB7|L|

All port lines are initialized as inputs, but this can be changed
by changing the value in the port's data direction register at
56579/$DD03. The handshake line (PC) for port B is also
available at pin 8 of the user port, These lines provide a full
eight-bit parallel I/O port for your own interfacing projects.
However, the port B lines also have another use. The 128
lacks a true RS-232 hardware interface, so the Kernal RS-232
routines program the user port lines to support RS-232 communications.
For RS-232, the port lines are used as follows:

|Bit|Line|Pin|RS-232 function|
|-|-|-|-|
|0|FLAG|B|This interrupt input is tied to the received data line. The high-to-low transition on the line at the beginning of the start bit for an incoming byte will cause a FLAG interrupt to initiate the reception of the byte|
||PB0|C|RXD (received data). This input line is used to read incoming data bits from the modem or other external device|
||PB1|D|RTS (request to send). This output line is used to signal the modem that the 128 is ready to send a byte|
|1|PB2|E|DTR (data terminal ready). This output line is used to signal the modem that the 128 RS-232 interface is active|
|3|PB3|F|RI (ring indicator). This input line is not supported by the Kernal RS-232 routines, but is intended to allow the modem to signal the 128 that a ringing signal has been detected on the phone line. The line, normally high, goes low when a ring is detected. (Commodore modems support this line.)|
|4|PB4|H|DCD (carrier detected). This input line is used to allow the modem to signal the 128 that it has detected another modem on the other end of the telecommunications link. The line, normally high, goes low when the incoming carrier signal is detected|
|5|PBS|J|This line is not formally assigned, but Commodore modems use it to control whether or the not the modem is connected to the phone line. Since the line is configured by the IOINIT routine as an input, you must change the corresponding data direction register bit to %1 to use the line as an output for this control function. Writing a %0 to this bit will connect the modem to the phone line (the off-hook state), while writing a %1 will disconnect (hang up) the modem|
|6|PB6|K|CT5 (clear to send). This input line is used to allow the modem to signal the 128 that it is ready to accept another byte|
|7|PB7|L|DSR (data set ready). This input line is used to allow the modem to signal the 128 that it is active|
||PA2|M|The following port A line is also used: TXD (transmitted data). This output line is used to send data bits to the modem or external device|

### Data direction registers
These registers specify whether the lines of ports A and B will
be inputs or outputs. Refer to the discussion of the CIA #1
data direction registers at 56322-56323/$DC02-$DC03 for details of how
these registers operate. For CIA #2, the IOINIT
routine [$E109](E000#E109)-part of both the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences-
initializes the port A DDR (56578/$DD02)
to 63/$3F, making port A lines PA0-PA5 outputs and
lines PA6-PA7 inputs, and the port B DDR (56579/$DD03) to
0/$00, making all port B lines inputs. The port A setting is not
changed by any other ROM routine. Bits 0-1 of the port A
register should always remain set to %1 to keep PA0-PA1
outputs for the VIC video bank selection function. You can
change the setting of the port B register freely to achieve the
desired user port I/O configuration. The routine to set up CIA
#2 for R5-232 communications [$F0B0](E000#F0B0) will set the port B
DDR to 6/$06, which changes lines PB1-PB2 to outputs and
all the others to inputs. See the discussion of the data registers
at [$DD00-$DD01](#DD00) for more information on the
uses of the port lines.

### Timer A latch/counter registers
Refer to the discussion of CIA #1 timer A at [$DC04-$DC05](DC00#DC04)
for details of how these registers operate. For CIA #2, the latch value for the
timer is not specifically initialized during the reset or RUN/STOP-RESTORE
sequences, although resetting the system will automatically set the latch
count to 65535/$FFFF. The only use for this timer in system
ROM is during the routines which transmit bits over the RS232 interface, where it
is used to determine the duration of
outgoing bits. After RS-232 transmission is completed, the
timer will continue running with a latch count value dependent on the baud rate
used in the RS-232 communications.

### Timer B latch/counter registers
Refer to the discussion of CIA #1 timer B at [$DC06-$DC07](DC00#DC06)
for details of how these registers operate. For
CIA #2, the latch value for the register is not specifically initialized during
the reset or RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences,
although resetting the system will automatically set the latch
count to 65535/$FFFF. The only use for this timer in system
ROM is during the routines which receive bits from the RS232 interface, where it
is used to determine the duration of incoming bits. After RS-232 reception is
completed, the timer
will continue running with a latch count value dependent on
the baud rate used in the RS-232 communications.

###Time-of-day clock registers
Refer to the discussion of the CIA #1 time-of-day clock registers at
[$DC08-$DC0B](DC00#DC08) for details of how these
registers operate. Like the CIA #1 time-of-day clock, these
registers are unused in 128 mode, and are available for your
own timekeeping projects.

## 56588 $DD0C D2SDR <a name="DD0C"></a>
### Serial data register
Refer to the discussion of the CIA #1 serial data register at
[$DC0C](DC00#DC0C) for details of how this register operates. Unlike
the serial data line from CIA #1, the serial port (SP) line from
CIA #2 is not used by the 128. It is, however, available at pin
7 of the user port on the back of the 128, along with the CNT
Une (at pin 6), so you can use this port for your own interfacing projects.

## 56589 $DD0D D2ICR <a name="DD0D"></a>
### Interrupt control register
Refer to the discussion of the CIA #1 interrupt control register
at [56333/$DC0D](DC00#DC0D) for details of how this register operates.
Because of the way CIA #2 is wired into the 128 system, the interrupts
it generates trigger processor NMI interrupts instead
of the IRQ interrupts generated by CIA #1. The IOINIT routine [$E109](E000#E109),
executed during both the reset and RUN/
STOP-RESTORE sequences, initializes the interrupt mask for
this register to 0/$00, disabling all interrupt sources. Any CIA
#2 interrupt source can trigger an NMI interrupt, but 128
ROM routines use only three of the possible sources: NMI interrupts
generated by FLAG, timer A, and timer B are used to
drive RS-232 communications. You can use any CIA #2 source
to generate an NMI interrupt for your own purposes. (The
FLAG interrupt input line is available at pin B of the user
port.) However, you'll have to write your own interrupt handling routine.
The standard NMI handler [$FA40](E000#FA40) assumes that
any CIA #2-generated interrupt it encounters is for RS-232.

### Control registers A and B
Refer to the discussions of CIA #1 control registers A and B at
[$DC0E](#DC0E) and [$DC0F](#DC0F), respectively, for details of
how these registers operate. For CIA #2, these registers are
both initialized to 8/$08 by the IOINIT routine [$E109](E000#E109), part
of both the reset and RUN/STOP-RESTORE sequences. This
value leaves both rimers stopped and set for one-shot mode.
The only ROM routines which change those settings are the
Kernal's RS-232 I/O routines. Timers A and B are used to
generate the NMI interrupts which drive the transmission and
reception of bits over the RS-232 interface. When RS-232
transmission is started, timer A is started, and it will continue
running in continuous mode even after the transmission is
completed and the logical file for RS-232 is closed (56590/$DD0E
will be set to 1/$01). Likewise, timer B is started when
the first RS-232 byte is received, and will continue running in
continuous mode even after the reception is complete and the
logical file has been dosed (56591/$DD0F will be set to
1/$01).

### CIA #2 register images
Due to incomplete address decoding, images of the CIA chip
registers appear repeatedly every 16 bytes throughout the remainder
of this page of memory. That is, storing a value in
any location in this range with an address that is an exact
multiple of 16 greater than one of the base register addresses
has the same effect as storing the same value in one of the
base register locations. For example, storing a value in
[$DD10](#DD10) or [$DDF0](#DDF0) has the same effect as storing
a value in [$DD00](#DD00). However, it's better programming
practice to use the officially designated register addresses.
